smlNotes
========
This is a collection of working notes and code on various aspects of statistical machine learning. 

Different topics will be divided amongst different folders and in cases where
the data is proprietary or too large to upload, simplified (sampled) data or pickle files
are provided instead. 

Various modules/packages maybe required to run these files. 
For Python files an Anaconda install might be the simplest way to avoid checking through 
all the dependencies.
