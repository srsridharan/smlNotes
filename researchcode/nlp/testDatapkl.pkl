Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \n\nRegards, \nWm. Hathaway \nBaltimore MD \n'

IMHO the wider meaning is not\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\n:  be!  [....]\n\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\n\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \'hacker\'\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\n\nI, on the other hand, know what \'hacker\' means from those who consider\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".\n(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\n\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \'a UNIX\n     hacker\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \'password\n     hacker\', \'network hacker\'.  See {cracker}.\n\n     The term \'hacker\' also tends to connote membership in the global\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\n\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\'ll quickly be labeled\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\n\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\n\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\n     project.\n\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\n     see themselves as `benign\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\n\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\n     hackerdom\'s most valuable intangible asset.\n\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\n: says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)\n\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \'hacker\'.  So,\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\nworkplace.  (This means that \'hacker\' is defined in terms of some well-known\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\n\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\'t work that way.\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\n\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\nto communicate.

Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn\'t allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n"Ctrl Any<Key>q".\n\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "For information\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...", this is so you\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to\n>Vol. 4 it says, "Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is\n>nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For\n>example, the translation:\n>\tShift<Key>q:\tquit()\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it\'s not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou\'re a Motif implementor, I\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\'s\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\n\nIf you mean "menu accelerator", no it\'s not possible.  That\'s according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\n>can\'t use XtInstallAccelerators().\n\nI can\'t think of a reason why not.\n\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\n>menu entry.\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell\'s\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.\n\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\n'

The assignment is to come up with a product and create a\nmarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at\nthis point.  Well, my group\'s plan is to market a "full page" monitor\nfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed\nby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology\'s PaletteBook\nscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you\nwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,\ntechnical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen\nand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR "full" height. \nThe screen would probably be monochrome.\nThe motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very\npopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word\nprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient\nto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and\napplications, color screens aren\'t really a neccessity.  We could\nhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.\n\nNow, please don\'t write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really\nneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me\nvia email and let me know:\n1. If you would consider buying a "full page" laptop screen\n2. How much you would be willing to pay for it\n3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea\n\nAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,\nbut who knows!), please send me some.\n\nThanks in advance!!!\n\n-Mike\n'

Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\nR=8800Mpc.  \n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\nold standby formula:\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms "Xt" and "Intrinsics" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\'t think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\nlittle harder because you\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\n\n/*\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\n * than the default visual.\n *\n * To compile:\n *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\n *\n * To run:\n *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\n *\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\n * to install.\n */\n\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n\tVisual\t*visual;\n\tint\tdepth;\n} OptionsRec;\n\nOptionsRec\tOptions;\n\nXtResource resources[] =\n{\n\t{"visual", "Visual", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n\t{"depth", "Depth", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n};\n\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\n{\n\t{"-visual", "*visual", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\n\t{"-depth", "*depth", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\n};\n\n\n\nint\nmain (argc, argv)\n\tint\t\targc;\n\tchar\t\t**argv;\n{\n\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\n\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\n\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\n\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\n\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\n\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\n\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\n\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\n\tArg\t\targs[10];\n\tCardinal\tcnt;\n\tchar\t\t*name = "test";\n\tchar\t\t*class = "Test";\n\n\t/*\n\t * save the command line arguments\n\t */\n\n\txargc = argc;\n\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\n\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\n\n\t/*\n\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\n\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\n\t */\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\n\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\n\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\n\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\n\t{\n\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\'s offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget\'s memory is actually free()\'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit\'s immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS\'s it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is "tail -f filename".\n\nIt\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn\'t work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn\'t completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\'t also deal with signals at this\npoint I don\'t know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I\'ve always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer\'s Guide and Specification", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O\'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO\'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I\'m finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, "The X Resource" and the "The X Journal".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  "The X Resource"\nis published quarterly, by O\'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I\'ve found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n"The X Journal" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what\'s going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun\'s Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I\'ve never used it so can\'t comment on its quality.\n\t  I\'ve heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I\'ve never seen\n\t  them so I can\'t comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I\'m working on.  It\'s still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, "name", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = "name";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer "3" instead of the floating point value "3.2".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t"True"\t\t1\n\t"False"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the "quark" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\'t necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a "snapshot" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the "fromVal" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the "toVal" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The "converter_data" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The "args" and "num_args" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the "toVal" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the "num_args" and "args" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a "cache" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon\'t cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe "destructor" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the "to" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the "to" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee "Multi-user Application Software Using Xt", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a "quit" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\'s enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User\'s per host defaults file\n\t4. User\'s defaults file.\n\t5. User\'s per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program "xrdb" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\'s Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication\'s class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file "type".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string "app-defaults"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. "ja_JP.EUC")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. "ja")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display\'s language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display\'s language string\n\nLet\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\'s class name is\n"Myterm". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet\'s consider another example. This time, let\'s set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\'s source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the "myterm" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm "*customization: -color"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C" then the expanded pathname would be\n"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\'s home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to ".", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to "./", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\nsays:\n\n \t"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended."\n \nyou may not infer from the word "appended" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\n> stays set to TRUE.\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a "deficiency"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The "deficiency" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n> Is this a problem with "mwm" or is there something\n> else which needs to be done?\n\nYou\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n> If the problem is "mwm", what is the fastest\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can\'t.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror ("malloc in xyzzy()");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\'ve\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\'m\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = "abcdef";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I\'d call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I\'d recomend getting "purify" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\'s.  It\'s a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\'s nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix\'s and has pretty similar features is "The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\'ll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the "-sync" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\'t run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource "xtIdentifyWindows" or the class resource\n"XtDebug" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm \'*XtDebug:true\' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it\'s children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It\'s a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\'ll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can\'t give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my "real" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won\'t get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive\'\' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag \'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a "standard" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.\n-- \nPete Ware\t\t\t\t\tware@cis.ohio-state.edu\nCIS Dept, Ohio State University\t\t\tw/ (614) 292-7318\n228 Bolz Hall, 2036 Neil Ave.\t\t\th/ (614) 538-0965\nColumbus, OH 43210\n'

The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In\nthis method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point\nof the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,\nthen it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which\nmay make you headache.\n\nThe second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and\nall the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the\nsuccessive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then\nit is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.\n\nMy experience tells the second method is relible.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nYeh\nUSC\n'

aS'From: baez@guitar.ucr.edu (john baez)\nSubject: End of the Space Age\n\nThere is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\'s\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\'d post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the "Space Age" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, "What\'s New" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\'s clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our "mind\nchildren" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America\'s Space Age won\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\'s science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\'s\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\nits competitiveness agenda.\n\n......\n\n"I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen\nnow," says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Lab in Pasadena.  "We\'ve put off a lot of things we shouldn\'t\nhave.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a\n$40-billion one filled with white elephants."\n'

I don\'t think it is the\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\n\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\n\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\n\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\n  between MSC and BC).\n\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\n  references).\n\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS\'s\nhype about portability to other vendor\'s compilers will be just that.\n\n-- \n      If these were my employer\'s opinions, I wouldn\'t be posting them.\n###############################################################################\n  "Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression "R-dot-bar sub n" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\'s energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a "dead" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a "dead" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers\' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\'s lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\n    is known). Titan\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\'s liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\n    location of the heliopause.\n\n\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\n\n\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\n\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\n\t     craft in solar orbit.\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\'s\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet\'s surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\'s Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\'s. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\'s radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\'s atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works\n    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market\n    bookstore.\n\n    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):\n\n      J.

I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth\'s\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com\n\nNEXT: FAQ #11/15 - Upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules\n'

aS'From: rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca (Ross Mitchell)\nSubject: 66DX2 ISA,VLB xor 50DX EISA ??  Advice wanted...\n\n\nHi:\n\nI need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!\nI want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  \n\n     -\tEditing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)\n\n     -\tCreating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)\n\n     -\tEditing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under \n\tWindows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel\n\n     -\tUsing the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, \n\ttalking to our network of Sparcstation\'s - this is where a lot of\n\tthe images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.\n\nI\'ve read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,\nand decided that a "nice" system (price/performance) would be:\n\n\t486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus\n\t15" monitor, 1280x1024 NI\n\t3Com Etherlink III 16bit\n\tMaxtor 240MB IDE hard drive\n\nHowever, the parts don\'t fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these\ntogether, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn\'t run at 50MHz - surprise\nsurprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I\'m surprised that they even\nhave a 50MHz local bus running...\n\nI have a choice now between basically the above system but with a\n486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus\nthe non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind\nthat I\'m primarily interested in the last two tasks?  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any \nspeedy help would be appreciated even more!!)\n\n\n\nBTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following \nconfiguration:\n\n\t486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram\n\tATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram\n\t14" monitor, 1024x768 NI\n\tSMC Ethercard 8 bit\n\tMaxtor 120MB IDE hard drive\n\nWe\'re quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!\n~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or\nbeen uncovered!  \n\nThere doesn\'t seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish\nrunning the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take\na long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).\n\nThere\'s not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive\ndon\'t leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with\nmedium size images.\n\nI have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This\nmachine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec \non the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases\ntransfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large \nimages).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it\nmake a difference?  I\'m hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice \n(above), for that reason.\n\nAlso, are there DX2-100\'s on the horizon?  What about DX3-99\'s?  DX3-150\'s ???!\n\nAny information is greatly appreciated.\n\n-----\nRoss Mitchell, Imaging Research Lab, |   rmitch@irus.rri.uwo.ca\nJohn P. Robarts Research Institute   |\nP.O.

When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M\nharddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space \nwould cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-\nuartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and \nyou will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  \n\nParticularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a\nseveral-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files \nwith DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like \nos, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are \npricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much\nit would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a \nuseful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though\nI must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my \ncomputer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to \nbecause I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, \nsoftPC or trying any unix os!)\n\n-Peter\nbell@minerva.cis.yale.edu \n"

It had  \ngiven us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  \nhas an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  \naftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics "SIMMer").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  \nthrough the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  \nrectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  \nto put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  \n26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  \ndown, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  \ncould try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  \nthat we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.

Moral rights and natural rights are all well and\ngood, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone\nrepresenting you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or\nthe church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and\nthen enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution\nprovides a "Bill of Rights" from which most if not all legal rights are\nconsidered to derive.  I\'m sure that most other countries have\ncomparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right\nto a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the\nU.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To\nkeep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law\nand the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague,\nsomething I know little about.\n\nDoug Loss\nloss@husky.bloomu.edu\n'

I have attempted to gather as many case histories as\npossible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies\nprobably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that\nsuccess rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24\nmachines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.\nThis is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.\n\nThanks to all who contributed to this poll. \n\n\nIssues:\n\n\tSpeed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without\n\t\tadd on cards.

No machine with the Nubus adapter\n\t\twas able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to\n\t\tachieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place\n\t\n\t\tAt speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and\n\t\thi density floppy disk problems have been reported.\n\t\t\n\t\tNote: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not\n\t\t\ttested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,\n\t\t\tthe 25 mhz operational machines may well work at\n\t\t\thigher speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\tDamage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad.

But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited\nthe software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He\nalso noted that the software people were starting to feel management\npressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)\n\nAmong other things, the software people worked very hard to get things\nright for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure\nduring those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.\nAs a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted\non one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.\n\nAs Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.\nSoftware that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the\nexperimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.\n(None of the experimenters could afford it.)\n-- \nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\n"

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for\n many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size\n and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard\n x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,\n bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)\n may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different\n line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of\n distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in\n the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek\n alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts\n can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device\n drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile\n format and renderer.\n\n The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.\n The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly\n granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without\n consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT\n object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it\n is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely\n available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed\n somewhere in the documentation for the package.\n\n We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of\n user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any\n published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,\n which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that\n as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the\n kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest\n in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only\n afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on\n those which help us get our work done.\n\n PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically\n without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub\n routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any\n modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the\n header file "plplot.h"; see the documentation for more details.\n\n The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of\n several TeX files; please consult this for additional information (\'latex\n plotdoc\').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to\n the code, so don\'t be surprised if some known features are not explained\n there.  Consult \'Changes.log\' to see a list of recent changes.  \n\n At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:\n\n\t Unix:\tSunOS\n\t\t A/IX \n\t\t HP-UX\n\t\t Unicos\n\t\t DG/UX\n\t\t Ultrix\n\t\t SysV\n\t\t Linux\n\n\t Amiga/Exec\n\t MS-DOS\n\t OS/2\n\t NeXT\n\n For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:\n  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual\n  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.\n\n To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to\n plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.\n\n CREDITS\n -------\n\n PLPLOT is the result of the effort of many people, so it is impractical to\n list all the contributors.

It allows composite\nmultimedia objects to be built from media objects.\n\nSpecifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available\nin InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the\nsource code for the original classes (though several configuration\nfiles for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). \n \nCurrently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN\nworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.\n\nXavier has been tested in the following environments:\n\nSUN:\n  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC\n  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later\n  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1\n\nNEC(EWS):\n  Machine : EWS4800/210,230\n  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2\n  C++     : C++ Release3.1\n\nIt can be obtained via anonymous ftp from \n\n         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/\n          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)\n\nWe are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.\nIf you are interested, please contact\n               \n                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. \n\nI will add your e-mail address to our list.\n\n[Reference]\no Rei Hamakawa, Hizekazu Sakagami, Jun Rekimoto:\n  Audio and Video Extension to Graphical Interface Toolkits,\n  The Third International Workshop on Network and Operating\n  System Support for Digital Audio and Video, San Diego, 1992\n\n***********************************************************************\n* _                                                                   *\n*  \\ \\      Rei Hamakawa (e-mail: rei@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp)               *\n*   |o|                                                               *\n*   |o|     C & C Systems Research Laboratories                       *\n*   |o| __  NEC Corporation                                           *\n*  O| || /  1-1, Miyazaki 4-Chome,      TEL : +81-44-856-2271         *\n*  O| || |  Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki,       FAX : +81-44-856-2232         *\n*  O| \\/ |  Kanagawa 216 JAPAN                                        *\n*    \\__/                                                             *\n***********************************************************************\n"

There is an option\n(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to\nCPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives\nthe VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)\nare applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to\nenable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.\n\nThis is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-\ntations.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nStrictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at\nleast one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.\n\n-- \nGary Korenek   (korenek@ferranti.com)\nNetwork Management Technology Incorporated\n(formerly Ferranti International Controls Corp.)\nSugar Land, Texas       (713)274-5357\n"

Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and\n: found what I was looking for.\n\n: ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one\n: for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies\n: from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and\n: which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).\n: eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris\n: 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an\n: unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any\n: given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.\n\nYou'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each\nmodifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier\nyou want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only\nway to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are \nused to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock\nmodifier).\n\nI don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous\nassignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then\none modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.\n\nX doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. \n\nHope that helps,\n\nDave Lapp\n\nStandard Disclaimer etc...\n"

They\nkeep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it,\nand change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility. \nThat would probably make me happy.\n\nab\n"

It\'s more likely that the Moon will never\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\nmaterials we can\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \nand it\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\'s heat \nsink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\'s a very minor \nactivity in the global scope of things.\n\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\'s likely too low to prevent\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\'s\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\n\nWe don\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\'s because we don\'t have to\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\'ll use the\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\ncenturies, if not much longer.\n\nLuna\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\nconventional warfare again. There\'s little glory in watching from a\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\nultimate profit either.\n\nGary\n-- \nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \n'

The more specific you\nare, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the \nexact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote \ndoesn\'t work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary \n(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?\n\n\tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)\nare publishing more articles on X.

(How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O\'Reilly\'s Volume 0, "X Protocol\nReference Manual." A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press\'s editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O\'Reilly\'s\n"Programmer\'s Supplement for Release 5". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n\tMIT\'s role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium\'s activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace\'s \n(formerly Solbourne\'s) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user\'s choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the "PHiGS Extension to X".\n\tPHiGS stands for "Programmer\'s Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn\'t do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don\'t *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn\'t \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD\'s XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton\'s talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom\'s Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen\'s window manager tiles windows so that they don\'t overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital\'s dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP\'s window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix\'s window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull\'s Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun\'s PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne\'s swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT\'s new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom\'s Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun\'s olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF\'s mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology\'s terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur\'s (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP\'s MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI\'s enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn\'t.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application "xplaces" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP\'s vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC\'s session manager?\n\n\tDEC\'s session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using "xset r on|off". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn\'t provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options "-ar1 350 -ar2 30" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do "macro expansion."\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string("setenv DISPLAY unix:0")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special "remapper" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

As published in "US Industrial Outlook 1993" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year\'s projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be "adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans."                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  "Space Business Indicators" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year\'s data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\'t believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year\'s DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\'s Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request "launch on demand" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\'s Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/"Spacelifter" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all "ELV upgrade" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed "Spacelifter" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\'s budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC "GO-AHEAD"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a "Star Wars" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\'S SPACE BIZ "STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst\'s report Morgan Stanley said "We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit."  Based upon discussions with GD\'s corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\'s projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\'s space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\'s Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\'s.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\'s Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\'s average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren\'t outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\'t flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce\'s Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the "Aerokosmos" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the "Severkosmos", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n\'Sineva\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There\'s very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\'t identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\'s Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970\'s and early 1980\'s. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth\'s upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\'s PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as "the main \nalternative rocket supplier" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of "off the shelf" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite\'s communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is "Asiasat-\n2", but I don\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based "Asiasat" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\'s \naerospace technology to the level of the world\'s top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely "made in Korea."  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We\'ll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm\'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?  This column\'s already full?  And I still have bunches of \ncommercial space developments to report on.  As I said at the start \nof this, column there\'s been a lot of interesting happenings - but \nI\'ll have to put them into the next issue.  \n   Looking ahead, I\'ve got several articles in the works on new \nhappenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market, \nmore news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on \nthe market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other \ninteresting developments. \n   And as always, I hope you folks find this stuff useful and \ninteresting -- Any and all comments are welcome. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nWales Larrison                          Space Technology Investor  \n"Felicitas multos habet amicos"             P.O.

The lines translate to the top of the screen and\nhave a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they\nare a few millimeters apart).\nI admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,\nespecially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.\nApplications which produce this effect are:\n- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)\n- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU\n\nThe machines use their built-in video and drive the old \nApple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  \nThe effect is independent of the settings in the following control \npanels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) \n        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).\n\nHave you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?\n\nThanks,\nFred\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFred Walsteijn                                | Internet: walsteyn@fys.ruu.nl\nInstitute for Marine and Atmospheric Research | FAX:      31-30-543163\nUtrecht University, The Netherlands           | Phone:    31-30-533169\n"

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle\'s robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t"Basically what we\'ve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks," Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations."\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate," said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"\nHeflin said.  "In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives."\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training "runs" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour\'s June flight and Discovery\'s July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.\n\n- end -\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n'

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\n          users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond\n          PHIGS".\n\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\n          based on PHIGS.\n\n          Next year\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\n\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\n\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\n          mainframes.\n\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\n          and translucency.\n\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.

A brochure from his\npublisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough\nto type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's\nstrong interest in vaporware spacecraft...\n\n                 ==================================\n\n                         The Dream Machines:\nAn Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature\n\n                            By Ron Miller\n                  with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\nOrig. Ed. 1993\nPre-publication $84.50\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\n\n\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\nreach them.   \n\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\n\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\nfictional\n\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\ncontemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare\nillustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and\ndrawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and\nobscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA\narchives\n\nAn index, bibliography, and appendices are included.\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPart I  The Archaeology of the Spaceship (360 B.C. to 1783 A.D.)\nPart II The invention of the Spaceship (1784-1899)\nPart III The Experimenters (1900-1938)\nPart IV The World War (1939-1945)\nPart V  The Golden Age of the Spaceship (1946-1960)\nPart VI The Dawn of the Space Age (1961 to the present)\n\nABOUT RON MILLER\n\n[The brochure has a page of stuff here; I'll try to hit the high\nspots.]\n\nFormer art director for Albert Einstein Planetarium  at Smithsonian's\nNational Air and Space Museum\n\nMember of International Association for Astronomical Arts, member of\nInternational Astronautical Association, Fellow of the British\nInterplanetary Society,  consulting editor for *Air & Space\nSmithsonian* magazine\n\nAuthor, co-author, editor, or sole illustrator on many books since\n1979, including *Space Art*, *Cycles of Fire*, *The Grand Tour*, and\nmany others, as well as many articles and papers\n\nBook jackets and interior art for over a dozen publishers \n\nContributor to IBM traveling exhibition and book *Blueprint for Space*\n\nProduction illustrator for movies *Dune* and *Total Recall*\n\nDesigner of ten-stamp set of commemorative space postage stamps for\nU.S. Postal Service in 1991 (Solar System Exploration)\n\nORDERING INFORMATION\n\nPre-publication price $84.50 before 1 May 1993\nAfterwards, price will be $112.50\n\nKrieger Publishing Company\nPO Box 9542\nMelbourne, FL 32902-9542\nUSA\nDirect order line (407)727-7270\nFax (407)951-3671\n\nAdd $5.00 for shipping by UPS within USA for first book, $1.50 for each\nadditional book.  \n\nFor foreign orders, add $6.00 for first book, $2.00 for each\nadditional.

Cassini is a joint\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\'s atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\'s\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\'s atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn\'s satellites and the major division in its rings.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\n\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\'s south pole\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\n    that\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\n\n    While in Jupiter\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

The only thing you can do to upgrade to\nthe maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,\ngiving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling\nTechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....\n\n<==================================+==================================>\n  Peter Haase                      +    Internet: haase@meediv.lanl.gov\n  Network Manager                  +    Los Alamos National Laboratory\n"

Connect:\n        GND1    to    GND2\n\tRxD1    to    TxD2\n\tTxD1    to    RxD2\n\tDTR1    to    DSR2\n\tDSR1    to    DTR2\n\tRTS1    to    CTS2\n\tCTS1    to    RTS2\n  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:\n        RI, DCD\n  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.\n  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally\nhave those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2\nto pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.\n \n  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection\ncan be used. Connect:\n        GND1    to    GND2\n\tRxD1    to    TxD2\n\tTxD1    to    RxD2\nAdditionally, connect (if software needs it):\n        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1\n\tRTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2\n\tDTR1    to    DSR1\n\tDTR2    to    DSR2\nYou won't need long wires for these!\n  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission\nbetween two PCs (see software section for details).\n  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from\nthe PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals\nand DSR & CTS are outputs!\n.-.-.-.- end .-.-.- \n\nMichael\n--\n*  michael@jester.gun.de  *   Michael Gerhards   *   Preussenstrasse 59  *\n                          *  Germany 4040 Neuss  *  Voice: 49 2131 82238 *\n"

aS'From: stein@watson.ibm.com (Arthur Stein)\nSubject: Scientific Visualization of Chemical Systems\n\nmolecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into\na  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a\ndecisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to\nbuild, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.\n \nWhile computer scientists are conversant in the language of their\nown discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,\nsimulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.\nSimilarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms\nand technological advances in graphical computing.\n \nThis interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap\nbetween computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry\nresearchers who wish to be more than just casual users of\nprepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to\nbe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets\nfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and students\nwill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises\nand projects will be carried out using data-flow programming\n(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have\naccess to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video\nrecording equipment.\n \nAudience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological\n           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art\n           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists\n           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of\n           scientific visualization.\n \n           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a\n           first-come first-served basis.\n \nLevel:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits.

The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\n\n\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\n\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\n\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\n--  \n=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=\n Eric Choi - Internet: Eric.Choi@p5.f175.n2240.z1.fidonet.org\n'

I have a 386 PC with lots of disk space and memory, a Postscript \nlaser, Win3.1, Finale 2.0.1 and I recently installed ATM 2.0. I've been \nfiddling around with the Windows setup for some time, and when I needed to do \nsome work with Finale things didn't print properly. It might - and it might \nnot - have anything to do with the installation of ATM from 1.something to \n2.0, but I don't have the old ATM lying around anomore. \n\nThe most annoying problem was that the Petrucci font didn't print, which is a \nrather important font :-) \n\nI managed to get direct printing to work if I included OwnPS=0 in the \n[Finale] section of WIN.INI, but Compile PostScript Listing still doesn't \nwork; and it's those .EPS files I need. When I look at the .eps files \ngenerated the only font which appears there is Courier. I found out that if I \nmanually changed the Courier 24-point to Petrucci 24-point in the .EPS file \neverything worked ok, but I'd rather avoid that since I have a lot of songs \nto work with. \n\nAnd yes, in the Special/Font/Font names dialog box all the fonts I need are \nlisted, with the correct mapping between Finale, Screen and Printer fonts. \nFinale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works \nwell (that is, after I included OwnPS=0), and all my other Windows \napplications print Petrucci and the other fonts well. \n\nHas anyone encountered problems like this? \n\nWhat is the current version of Finale from Coda Music Software? I have 2.0.1\n\nAre the people at Coda available on Internet or X.400?\n\nI'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats\n-- \nInternet: mats@gar.no       QuikComm: mats@gar#@genor       ServerP: mats garp\nX.400:    g=Mats; s=Tande; o=Oslo; p=GR; A=Telemax; C=NO;\n"

Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format\nprogram (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from\ndebug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it "knows" about.\nSometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you\ncan enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a\nthird-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.\n\nIDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the\ndrive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant.

C9 has been modified to\ninclude Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due\nto Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument\ncalibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the\nspacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.\nThis information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements\nwhich occur during approach and mapping phases.

Windows NT (tm)\nis becomming usable.\n\nThere are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.\nFirst (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full-speed DOS box.\nWhat I mean is, I cannot (for instance) run Falcon 3.0 or any other\nresourse intensive program in a DOS box.  It absolutley crawls.  \nAnd my machine is a 486/33 with a 330MB HD and 16MB RAM.  If anyone\nknows how to get a fast DOS box (or full-screen for that matter), \nplease let me know.\n\nThe second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.\nFor instance, my PAS-16 has been demoted to running as a Sound Blaster\n(which is natively supported -- nice), because MediaVision hasn\'t \nproduced drivers yet.\n\nYour disk should be large enough to keep an 80MB DOS partition, and\ngive the rest over to Windows NT (tm).  The only thing is, whenever\nyou wanted to run Windows programs, you\'d have to reboot and log into\nWindows NT (tm), instead of just typing WIN.\n\nWindows NT (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal Windows\nthough.  It\'d be a good choice if you have the resources.  You should\nreally have *at LEAST* 8MB RAM though.  One last thing, modems work\nwell enough, but I have yet to get my FAX card to work, and I\'ve never\nheard of anyone else who did either.\n\nIt\'s only better than UNIX because it runs killer software out of the\nbox, whereas with UNIX there isn\'t the same availablity.\n\nI guess it comes down to -- Windows NT (tm) is not yet for the faint\nof heart, it\'s still a beta.  But it\'s a very GOOD beta.\n\n-- \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Scott Reimert  \\    reimert@mamacass.etdesg.trw.com     /Standard disclaimer:\nRedondo Beach, CA \\______________________________________/"Blah blah blah ...

aS'From: Pankaj Saxena <U09416@uicvm.uic.edu>\nSubject: TCP/IP through Windows 3.1\n\nI don\'t know much about computers, so please bear with me. Here\'s my question:\n\nCONTEXT: I use a package called SLIP on my home computer to connect to the\n         university mainframe (an IBM 3090 running VMS/MVS), and log on to my\n         account. When I installed SLIP on my computer, I had to configure it\n         for my modem (14.4 kbs Etronics internal) and had to supply the phone\n         number to dial to reach the mainframe. The way it works now is that\n         I type "telnet uicvm" or "tn3270 uicvm" (either will work) at the DOS\n         prompt. UICVM is the node name of the mainframe. The program then\n         dials the mainframe, establishes a protocol, and gives me the logon\n         screen. "TELNET" and "TN3270" are the names of batch files in my SLIP\n         directory. I have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the\n         session.\n\nPROBLEM: I would like to be able to do all this under Windows 3.1 because I\n         hardly ever use DOS directly. SLIP will not run under Windows. I\n         talked to the people at our computer center, and they suggested that\n         I use a packet driver called WINPKT.COM with SLIP. They gave me\n         instructions on how to load it before I start Windows, and how to\n         modify the TCPSTART and TCPSTOP batch files (in the SLIP directory)\n         to ensure that it would work. I did all that and I could run SLIP\n         from Windows, but there were other problems. For one thing, SLIP\n         would not hang up the phone when I exited. I had to run my communi-\n         cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when\n         that didn\'t work. For another, there were too many errors. It often\n         took me 3-4 tries to connect to the mainframe. Our computer center\n         does not support SLIP under Windows, so I can\'t keep going back to\n         them with more questions.\n\nQUESTION: Is there some other SHAREWARE package that will run under Windows\n         and do what SLIP is supposed to do? I need a package that is not too\n         expensive, which is why I am looking for shareware. I have heard that\n         there are regular commercial packages that do all this, but they cost\n         hundreds of dollars. These are the main requirements:\n\n         1. Must be able to run under Windows 3.1\n         2. Must allow VT100 and IBM TN3270 terminal emulation\n         3. Must allow ftp file transfers, since that\'s the only kind the\n            mainframe allows. No Y-modem or Z-modem etc. I believe the ftp\n            transfers are made through a kermit protocol, but I\'m hazy about\n            that.\n\n         A subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it\'s a true\n         Windows program (rather than a DOS program modified to run under\n         Windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently\n         with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet\n         session and other applications.\n\nAny information received is appreciated.\n\nPankaj Saxena\nu09416@uicvm.uic.edu\n'

aS'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\n\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the "wild\n>idea" stage or does it have real funding?\n  \n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\'s logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered "paid advertising" but rather\n"public relations", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis "advertising" as much as it is "public relations", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\'s which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than "public relations", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s upcoming movie "The Last\nAction Hero".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it "would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation."   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a "commercial launch" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL "BILLBOARDS"\n   Orbital "billboards" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in "The Man Who Sold the Moon".  Several\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the "Eiffel\nII" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\'s Bi-centennial.\n                                                (cont)\n\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\n'

It\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.

As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series (\'85-\'89), the PI\n(\'88-\'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D\'s - \'86-\'90), the Power\nSeries parallel systems (\'88-\'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\n18 months to 2 years.\n\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\ndon\'t, we become uncompetitive.\n\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can\'t wait to buy, but\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\nfor one in writing. If it\'s feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n|> \n|> Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\n|> keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\n|> pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\n|> just before the end of the quarter), but I\'m just a little tired of\n|> getting boned in the process.\n|> \n\nIf that\'s happening, it\'s becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n|> Maybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\n|> aren\'t entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,\n|> for instance) are.

aS'From: aew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca (Alan Walford)\nSubject: Summary: ATI Graphics Ultra Questions etc\n\n\nTo those interested in the new ATI Ultra Cards:\n\nI had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and\nhad asked confirmation of some opinions.\n\nThis message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that\nreplied.\n\n\n> 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.\n\na) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB\n   and EISA version should have no problems.\n \nb) I\'m pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn\'t\n   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way\n   of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this,\n   but apparently it doesn\'t work.  I posted some "help me" messages\n   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn\'t have this\n   problem.\n\nc) FALSE\n\nd) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M\n   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.\n\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\n\n\n> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches\n>    set but it is much slower.\n\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \n \nb) Dunno.\n\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\n\n\n> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.\n\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\n   non-interlaced.\n\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they\'ve tested a local bus version\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\n\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\n\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\n\n\n> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many\n>    cases.\n\na) They aren\'t perfect, but are much improved.  I don\'t recall the last time which\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\n   to software incompatibility.\n\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\n\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\n\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\n\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\n   the old driver.\n\n\n> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.\n\na) It\'s quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\n \nb) Yes - I\'ll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\n   every 20 minutes or so...\n\nc) Depends on many many things.\n\n\n> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)\n\na) I like it.\n\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\n\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\n\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\n\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar\nwith the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don\'t have\nan Graphics Ultra yet.)\n\nATI Graphics Ultra Plus:\n- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours\n- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600\n- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)\n  Stretch full motion video windows to full size\n- Fast VGA\n- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)\n- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)\n- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop\n- Around a 1/2 length card size\n- Priced from $400 U.S.\n\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro:\n- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus\n- Faster performance with VRAMS\n- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced\n- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel\n- Priced from $600 U.S.\n\nATI Technologies\n(416) 756-0718\n\nI hope this summary can be of use to you.\n\nAl\n\nP.S.  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other\n      than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few\n      years (which I generally liked).\n\n\n-- \nAlan Walford     Eos Systems Inc., Vancouver,B.C., Canada  Tel: 604-734-8655\naew@eosvcr.wimsey.bc.ca           OR        ...uunet!wimsey.bc.ca!eosvcr!aew  \n'

We use it to\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\nvideo to the Net.\n\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\n\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces "near VHS" quality at 30 fields per\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\nfind distracting.\n\nIf you can get past this problem, you\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\n\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\'ve ever\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\'ll recognize the methodology\nand the user interface.\n\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21" Apple mon-\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\n\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\nwill look better.\n\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\n\n\nDan Snodgrass\nMedia Services\nLewis & Clark College\nPortland\n'

Jordan implemented the system\ndependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,\ncall it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include\nfile for your specific machine or operating system using the basic\nimplementations. Since both Jordan and I haven\'t encountered a \nOS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven\'t gotten around to\nreally implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically\nfor just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file\ntty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all\nit still is probably better to implement a include file for each and\nevery operating system than \'#ifdef\'ing in existing ones. The type\nof mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm\nsources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a \ncouple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the \n"drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be \ncompiled into emu.\n\nIt shouldn\'t be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully\nrelies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don\'t have a linux\nsystem available to me, so I can\'t do the port myself. I would suggest\nyou read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or\nquestions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately\nwe have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we \njust don\'t have access to that many different systems.\n\nMichael\n\n\n--\nMichael Elbel, Digital-PCS GmbH, Muenchen, Germany - me@dude.pcs.com\nIntelligenz is sowieso nur wat fuer Doofe - Mia\nFermentation fault (coors dumped)\n'

Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \nequivalent amount of direct investment would.

Remember\n: those 21 Mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? These drives\n: are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb\n: disks. Sounds to me to be one great product for the PC market. Are the\n: prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently\n: not rewritable? I know about the new rewritable CDs and expect SONY to\n: develop the first MDs for the computer. My question is: why isn\'t there\n: any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?\n\nCertainly in the UK the 21Mb flopticals are about the same price as a\ncheap CD-ROM now (you seem to be able to get them for around GBP\n200-250). However the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128Mb) are much more\nexpensive - around the GBP 1000 mark.\n\nA couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb\nflopticals - are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do\nthey need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy\ndrive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk\nand hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.\n\nOn the subject of Sony developing MDs for computers, I have reread a\nPCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing\noptical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a\nproduct themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format\nis a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is\nidentical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was\nquoted as saying that a 2.5" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data\nthough he refused to comment on any possibility of this being\nproductized.\n\nThe article said that one of the problems holding back development in\nthis area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2\ndistinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it\nprobably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it\ninto the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it\nprobably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead\nto get MDs accepted.\n\n--\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndavid shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625\n                inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq\n\t\t"They didn\'t like the rates, they don\'t like the poll tax,\n\t\t and they won\'t like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley   \n'

When I ordered a 105mb hard drive from \nTC about 6 months ago, I received it in the mail, installed it, and \ndiscovered it DIDN'T WORK!!!  I sent it back to them, and they said they'd \nsend me a refund check.  IT TOOK MANY, MANY, MANY phone calls and hate-mail, \nas well as threats of lawsuit to get back my $250.00!  In fact, it took TWO \nWHOLE MONTHS of calling and threatening!  Every time I'd call, I would be \nput on the run-around until I finally wound up on an answering machine.  I'd \nleave my name and phone #, but I didn't even get called back *ONCE*.  I AM \nONE PISSED OFF T.C. CUSTOMER, \tAND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF, OR \nIF YOU WANT DECENT SERVICE, DO NOT --I REPEAT-- DO NOT BUY FROM THIS \nCOMPANY.  THE MONEY SAVED IS NOT WORTH THE ULCERS YOU WILL GET.  PASS THIS \nWORD AROUND TO YOUR FRIENDS.  \t\tCompanies like this do not deserve \nto stay in business, so let's not give them out hard earned money.  \n\nDiscount Micro, Systems Powerhouse, and Gateway 2000 all have given me \nexcellent service and speed in the past.

One concern was the possibility that\nthey would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one\nthat was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  \nI believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was\nas short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper\nenvelope of what the Shuttle can do.\n\nI have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought \ndown for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,\ncleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in\naddition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment \nmission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second \ntime.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a \nfew years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two \nservicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down \nand take it up again.\n\nBen\n\n"

It should be the only non-smt chip on\nthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.

Those are\nwhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have\nthe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:\n\n              5 + +    open\n              6 + +    open             \n              7 + +    open        \n              8 + +    open\n              4 + +    closed\n              3 + +    closed\n              2 + +    open\n              1 + +    open\n\n    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.\nTop to bottom.   +\'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8\nselect the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the\nsecond drive (drive 1).   \n\n      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it\'s a auto-config, and I\'ll have\nto look up how to do it... I don\'t have the big book right here.\n\n>2.)\tAre the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?\n\n      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not\nright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables\nare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it\nto the opposite side of the drive.    It\'s one or the other.   \n     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I\'ve thrown it on J3 a few\ntimes and banged my head for a day.....\n\n>3.)\tIs my system\'s BIOS in need of an upgrade?\n\n     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way\nto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:\n       \n        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)\n   \n    This will return the rom date, if it\'s of any use.\n\n>Keith Rice\n\n      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

Normally, the older boards have\na 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char\nthey received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the\nright software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars. \n\n> 2) What does it do for high-speed modems?\n> 3) Is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput?\n\nIf you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a\ntime and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are\nrunning a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the\ncpu cannot work the whole time with one task. \n\nThe result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.\n\n> 4) Is it only for internal modems?\n\nNO.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \n    for the planet Venus. \n\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \n\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\'\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \n\n        The Soviet probes\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\n    VENERAs\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\n\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\' \n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\n\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \n    across, due to Venus\' very dense atmosphere.\n\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\' \n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern "continent" of Ishtar Terra.  \n\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \n    probes maintained that distinction.\n\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\'s\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\n\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\n    gas to perform the operation.  \n\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\n\n        Venus by Balloon\n\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\'s mantle of \n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \n    the French space agency Centre National d\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\n\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\n\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \n\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \n\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \n    encounter.\n\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\n    Japan\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \n    comet, while Japan\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \n\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\n\n        The Soviets\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \n    location of the comet\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\n\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\n    successfully arrived. \n\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\n    permeated the planet\'s atmosphere. \n\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \n    had thought the planet\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\n\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\n    journey.  The layer\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \n\n        Early in the first balloon\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \n    miles) above the surface. \n\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\'s \n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\n\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\n    returned during the lander\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\n\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\'s results\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \n    over the last seven years.\n\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\n    bodies with one space vessel.\n\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the "continent" of Aphrodite \n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \n    miles) towards the surface.\n\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \n    through the balloon\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\'s nephelometer \n    failed to function.\n\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\n    Terra\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\'s resting place was smoother\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\n\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \n    hours.\n\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\n\n        Future Plans Diverted\n\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\n    the early 1990s.\n\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\'s \n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \n    the VEGA balloons\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\n\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\n    Mars\' largest moon, Phobos. \n\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\n\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\n    landing in March of 1989. \n\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \n\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \n    to "open up" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a "free market".\n\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \n    make money.  \n\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\n\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \n\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\n\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \n    probe\'s primary target\'s major moons in 1610.\n\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\'s first planetary\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\n    planet\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\n    that violent atmosphere.\n\n        On the Drawing Boards\n\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\n\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\n    to study Venus\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\n\n        Humans on Venus      \n\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\n    Earth\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \n    to speed up the planet\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\n    if not millennia.\n\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\n\n        Bibliography -\n\n         Barsukov, V.

The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,\nshow the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be\ninvoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse.

aS'From: sherwood@adobe.com (Geoffrey Sherwood)\nSubject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)\n\n\nI just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy\nwith the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time\nfutzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor\nis pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17" Magnavox went away.  It\nisn\'t as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the\nmonitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.\n\nIn going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors\nin 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program\nwhich uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,\nOrchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those\nare all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses\na Weitek VGA chip which also doesn\'t support them).  The Hercules Graphite\ncard does seem to have these modes, but I didn\'t run the same test cases as\nI did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to\nprint the splash screen for the Grolier\'s Encyclopedia, though, which the S3\ncards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.\n\nThe supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if\nyou tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors\nlisted plus \'Generic\', and if you choose Generic you can\'t get any high\nrefreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me\nthat the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz\nat 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution\nwas the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,\nand it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.\n\nThe higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone\nwith Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don\'t know what I have) he was unable\nto recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as\nhe could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn\'t have\nthe problem.  He didn\'t know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.\n\nThe board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules\nSpeedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results\nin pixels/second.  I don\'t have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they\nwere close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz\n386, ISA, so the numbers aren\'t really comparable.  The following numbers\nwere all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with\n8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it\ncomputes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.\n\n\nK means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second\n\n             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000\nChip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000\nDIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K\nMemory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M\nScreen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M\nVector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M\nVector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K\nPolygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M\nPolygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M\nTernary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K\nFont                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M\n\nThe DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers\nit to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as\nconversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to\nthe screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can\njust be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that\nface from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid\nvectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,\nfilled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics\noperations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two\nnumbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.\nWhen the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --\n1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds\nlike programming to a benchmark to me....\n\nI make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what\nI saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don\'t write disclaimers,\nbut this time maybe I\'d better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my\nwork (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the\nknowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.\n\ngeoff sherwood\n'

While\n     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher\n     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers\n     throughout the world. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ1:  Where can I get Gopher software?\n\nA1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory\n     /pub/gopher\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ2:  What do I need to access Gopher?\n\nA2:  You will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local PC\n     or workstation\n\n     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory\n     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous\n     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory\n     /pub/gopher.\n\n      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z\n      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog\n      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher\n      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *\n      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *\n      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/\n      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/\n      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/\n      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/\n      OS/2 2.0\t            :  /pub/gopher/os2/\n      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/\n\n     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the\n     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  \n\n      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client "The Gopher Book"\n        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip\n\n      A Macintosh Application, "MacGopher".\n        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *\n\n      Another Macintosh application, "GopherApp".\n        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP\n        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe\n\n      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS\n     \t bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe\n\n      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell\'s LAN Workplace\n      for DOS\n         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher\n\n      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX\n         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE\n\n\n     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.\n\n     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client\n     itself.

It is recommended that you run the client\n     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A\n     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,\n     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to\n     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?\n\nA3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize\n     network lag.\n\n     Telnet Public Logins:\n\n     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area\n     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------\n     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4\tgopher  North America\n     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America\n     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201\tpanda   North America\n     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe\n     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia\n     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden\n     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America\n     ecnet.ec\t\t           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador\n     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan\n\n\n     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of\n     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the\n     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)\n     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features\n     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file\n     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp\n     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?\n\nA4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University\n     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help\n     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  \n\n     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information\n     System used by a large number of sites in the world.\n\n     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to\n     count. \n\n     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached\n     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:\n   \n      Internet Gopher Developers\n      100 Union St. SE #190\n      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA\n\n     Or via FAX at:\n \n      +1 (612) 625-6817\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?\n\nA5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.\n     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: \n     \n       - Search local WAIS indices.\n       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher\n         clients.\n       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using\n         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nQ6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?\n\nA6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :\n\n     _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O\'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:\n                             ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)\n\n     _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet\'s Guide to Our World Online"\n     By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

As archie is to ftp archives, veronica \n     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher\n     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.\n     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy\n     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the\n     gopher protocol.\n\n     To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on \n     Minnesota\'s gopher server, or point your gopher at:\n\n     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) \n     Type=1 \n     Port=70 \n     Path=1/veronica \n     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQ8: What is Available for Biology?\n\nA8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information\n    availble to biologists now by gopher.\n\nHere is a brief list of the Biological Databases that you can search \nvia gopher:\n\n      2.

Now, here\'s the key: NEC *knows* that\nthe >=15" monitors\' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over\ndistances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore\n*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*\n(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN\nInformation Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and\nprobably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor\n(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my\ncase quite :).\n\n>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?\n\nI, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard\nmonitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,\nfinally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,\nbut a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying\nconvince me was "normal").

This may include the ability for the system to fully power down\nthe monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on\nautomatically.  (Is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?)\n\nGoals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30\nwatts for the system, not including the monitor (? don\'t quote me on\nthis).\n\nNote that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,\nespecially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.\nSun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for\nthe night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per\nyear.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would\nprobably have greater than double that value.\n\nGiven that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and\nhome computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),\nbuilding power consumption control into all machines has a potential to\ncut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.\n\nBTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving\nwork, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors\nwith the power switch on front.  There was some indication that\nmonitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate\nlots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but\nmight be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch\nin back.\n\n\n'

Many sites are listed as\n    providing \'anonymous FTP\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\n    on how to make requests.\n\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\n\n    Don\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is\n    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.\n\n\nVIEWING IMAGES\n\n    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly\n    large, and I won\'t attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To\n    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,\n    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\n    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP\n    sites.\n\n    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image\n    formats and how to get image viewing software.

These archives include many images and\n    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press\n    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please\n    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.\n\n    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in\n    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the\n    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).\n\n    To access the archives by email, send a letter to\n    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the\n    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:\n\n\tsend SPACE Index\n\tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.\n\n    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in\n    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use\n    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this\n    section for images or programs.\n\n    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image\n    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The\n    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are\n    available in these collections.\n\n    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory\n    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in\n    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is\n    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item "VIEWING IMAGES" below).\n\n    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to\n    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing\n    specific information.

aS'From: kayman@Xenon.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman)\nSubject: SUMMARY:  Canon BJ200 vs. HP DeskJet 500\n\n\nHello again,\n\nAbout a week and one-half ago I posted a query looking for people feelings\non the inkjet family of printers.  Specifically, a comparison between the\nCanon BJ200 (BubbleJet) and the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500.  Many people\nasked me to post the summary/account of all the postings and e-mail I\nreceived.  Below is my original query and the responses I received.  I have\nnot deleted any part of the responses, only the headers and signatures, so\nyou can extract what you find necessary.  Some people asked me for an\nunbiased account; however, the very nature of the question suggests\nfavoritism and biased comments, you must extract the information you\nbelieve unbiased and a fair representation of each printer.  There are a\nwide range of comments, each has its own value.  \n\nThere was no clear winner, some like the BJ200 (especially its\nprice/performance ratio), others preferred the durability and reliability\nof the DeskJet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid\nbackground).  Two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention, a new\nprinter to be introduced by Hewlett-Packard later this year (around\nsummertime), and an addition to the Epson product line (their first\ninkjet).  You will find that after the initial purchase, the costs of\nre-filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely\ndepends on where you purchase the re-fills or replacements -- so shop\naround first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your\nprinter).  No one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will\nprint, but I suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 - 1500 sheets\n(laser printers will do 4000-5000 sheets per toner cartridge).  Well,\nthat\'s a brief research summary of my personal research.  ENJOY!\n\n===========================================================================\n\n>Hello fellow \'netters.\n>\n>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I\n>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

Just using regular copier paper\nproduced fantastic results just in high quality mode.  I compared the\noutput of a Micrografx Designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my\nBJ 200 with the same drawing printed on an HP Laserjet IID and I was amazed\nhow well I could read the small print on the BJ 200.  Printing speed was\nseveral seconds faster on the BJ 200 which is amazing considering that the\nHP has 2.5M ram installed.  I measured the time from when the printer first\nindicated it was receiving data (as I used print manager in Windows).\n\nI showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one\nimmediately for his office, and two other engineers placed their orders\ntoo.  If you need CDW\'s phone number, it\'s 800-598-4239.  Delivery to NY\nwas two days.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nCraig Witkowski, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com\nMotorola Communications & Electronics Inc.\nGlen Rock,  NJ\n\n===========================================================================\n\nI own a Deskjet 500. Performance isn\'t spectacular under Windows using\nTrueType fonts but neither is the Canon from what I have seen. Quality for\nthe HP is very much dependent on paper quality - on \'standard\' photo-copy\npaper the characters have slightly \'frayed\' edges but on better quality\n\'distinction\' type paper things look better. For most applications I find\ncopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.  Comes with a Windows\ndriver, which seems to by-pass print manager, has a few\n\'intelli-fonts\'which are HP scaleable fonts - probably faster than TrueType\nbut haven\'t really tried them out. Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unless\nthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn\'t bother. The RAM cartridges\ncan\'t be used as buffer - soft fonts only.\n\nFor graphics, i.e. BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode via\nthe HP supplied Win driver. There a number of dither options such as\n\'scatter\', \'pattern\' etc.  The manual gives recommendations depending on\nthe type of image being printed.  Text is not so good in this mode. Problem\narises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.  The\nrange of tones for graphic images isn\'t brilliant but I think that is more\nof a limitation with inkjet printers in general.\n\n>From what I have seen the Canon is similar in most respects.\n\nHowever, a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from\nEpson.  This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producing\nlaser-like quality on normal copier paper.  Can\'t remember the model #, LX\n- something I think?\n\nI purchased my HP days before the Epson was released here :-{.  The\nintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.\n \n===========================================================================\n\nAbout a month ago, I got a Canon BJ200.  I absolutely LOVE it.  It is\nincredibly fast, except for printing from PSPICE (I don\'t know if you ever\ndo stuff with that or not.)  Most of the stuff I print is either from\nMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.  The only problems I\'ve had\nare printing headers/footers (the printer freaked out), and printing on\ncheap paper (lots of streaks).  Normal copy paper works great with it, you\ncan only tell it\'s not laser-printed by holding it, oh, less than twelve\ninches from your face.  (That is, if you\'re nearsighted, like me! :) ) The\nprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!  I have no other\ncomplaints.  The printer also can act just like some EPSON or another for\nthose archaic software packages that haven\'t written a driver for it yet.\nThe teeny-weeny footprint is a real plus, too--AND, if you purchase it\nbetween now and May 31, you get a $50 rebate from Canon!!  I bought mine\nfrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.  I have a friend\nwho has the HP you are looking at.  It also prints very well, and everyone\nhas drivers for it, BUT it is VERY slow!\n\nHope I helped!\n\n(360dpi sure looks great!)\n\nHeather Stehman\n\n===========================================================================\n\nIn article <1993Apr19.122649.25263@schbbs.mot.com>, CENG51@maccvm.corp.mot.com (Craig Witkowski) writes:\n> In message <1993Apr18.041741.6051@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU>\n> kayman@csd-d-3.Stanford.EDU (Robert Kayman) writes:\n> Hello fellow \'netters.\n> \n>>I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I\n>>should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.

I prefer the Deskjet.  The printing speed and quality\nare similar (I tested both with text and graphics before buying the Deskjet\nfor home).  The feature that sets the Deskjet apart is the driver support\nin so many applications.  The BJ ends up emulating the Epson LQ or IBM\nProprinter to get it to work with many non-windows apps and this will be\nthe case for a long time.  The design is superior if you just want to use\ncut paper, the Deskjet is quieter, AND the ink cartridges are quite a bit\ncheaper due to the number of Deskjets out there in comparision to the BJs.\n\n  Just my $0.02 worth..\n\n-- \nMike Mattix\nAgricultural Group of Monsanto\nP.O. Box 174\nLuling, LA 70070\nINTERNET Address: dmmatt@bigez.monsanto.com\n\n===========================================================================\n\n  Yes, there is the landscape mode printing problem, but it does not\npresent a problem in Windows as the Windows printer driver handles the\ntranslation.  I actually thought of some other points after I posted the\nnote.  The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around\nthe paper the Bubblejet does not.  You are right about the graphics\nresolutions, I tested the printers with the applications I had access to:\nWordperfect, Harvard Graphics, WinGIF, Paintshop PRO, and Paintbrush and\ncould not tell a difference.  In fact one of the HP Deskjet Windows drivers\ngives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer\nhence controlling the amount of ink you put down.  The Bubblejet did not.\nI had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no\ncomparision there.  Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.  In that configuration\nthe Bubblejet cost approximately $100 more than the Deskjet.\n\nI went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the Deskjet when I\nspent my own money.  BTW, I am replacing the BJ-300 with a Deskjet 500 at\nwork this month anyway.\n\nRegards\n\nMike Mattix\nAg Group of Monsanto\nLuling, LA\n\n===========================================================================\n\nI spent some time comparing the two.  We ended up getting the Bubblejet\nBJ-200 versus the HP.  Our reasons were:\n\n1) The HP seemed to have worse banding than the Canon\n2) 360dpi versus 300 - we felt we could see the difference\n3) Price - Canon has a $50 rebate program going on at the moment.\n\nThe BJ-200 was our choice over the BJ-10ex - we could have 100 pages in the\nBJ-200 feeder.  The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.\n\nAs you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.  We haven\'t done anything\nbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.  I\nknow that the Microsoft BBS has a newer windows driver than comes with the\nprinter, but I don\'t know how it compares (also the driver included with\nthe printer is Canon\'s whereas I don\'t know where the Microsoft BBS one\ncomes from - Microsoft?)\n\nHope this helps.\n-- \nThomas V.

The printing quality is a bit better,\nbut you you\'ve got much more possiblities. Don\'t forget the HP engine is at\nleast 2 years on the marked, the Canon engine (witch is also used in\nother "new" bubblejet printers like e.g. the Epson ones) is quite recently\navailable..\n\n> Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360\n> dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi).\n> Which is faster?

The Canon was a bit better..\n\nGreetz,\n\nKris\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhen we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to\ninkjet printers.  They have near laser quality, speed, and they are quiet.\nWe use both HP Deskjets and the Canon BJ-200s.  I prefer the paper handling\nqualities of the Deskjets but I feel the Canons have superior print\nquality.  The Ideal would be a Canon with a sheet feeder, however I did end\nup buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal).  Anyway, we are\nusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.  Out\nof 15 Deskjets and 4 BJ-200s I have only had one problem with a deskjet and\nthat was taken care of very quickly by HP.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Nate\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWhenever I buy anything I look at what the "experts" say, pick out the top\nfew and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt.  I\'ve been\nunusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so I\'ve done this a\nfew times including - about four months ago - with inkjet printers.\n\nI can\'t remember much about the process except that I read about three\nreviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top.  I\nbought the 500C because of the added dimension of colour (I intend to build\na multi- media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner\ntowards that).  Although I haven\'s used the colour thing in earnest yet I\ntried it out on a couple of Windows bitmaps and I was pleased with the\nresult.\n\nI note that even though you can now get the 550C (the one with both colour\nand mono with no need to change the cartridge), the 500C and 500 are still\nreadily available (at least in the UK).  The following are my\nviews/experience:\n\n\t1.\tI don\'t know anything about the Canon except that I came away\n\t\tfrom reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with\n\t\tthe idea that the HP offered the best performance/price ratio.\n\n\t2.\tI believe HP are the originals in the field - not always the\n\t\tideal place to be but the market\'s still young so one assumes\n\t\tthey have the expertise.\n\n\t3.\tThe 500C is worth the extra.  Operation in mono is perfectly\n\t\tacceptable and I get good crisp reproduction of fonts from\n\t\tWindows.\n\n\t4.\tI used to work for Monotype when they still manufactured\n\t\ttypesetters (before their AMERICAN owners closed them down!)\n\t\tand I can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is\n\t\tpretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...\n\n\t5.\tThe HP comes with a reasonable set of drivers.\n\n\t6.\tIf you buy it invest in the additional RAM pack - it\'s pretty\n\t\tslow with it, God knows what it\'s like without!\n\nI actually work in Germany and my PC is home in the UK so it\'s not in daily\nuse.  I would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and\nhaving a really dumb problem at the start it\'s easy peasy to operate.\n\nHope this is of use.\n\nRegards\n\nDavid\t\n\n===========================================================================\n\nJust bought the BJ-200.  I thought the price couldn\'t be beat ($329, with\n$50 rebate thru 5/31) and so far it is comparable, even superior, to the\nDeskJet in print quality.\n\nSpeed:   Per page rate seems to be faster (I don\'t have figures).\n         I don\'t print long docs, though.\n\nQuality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.  Print quality is\n         excellent as well, unless you use small fonts and hold it up\n         close; you can see a lot more "jaggies" than on a LaserJet.\n         The 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the\n         page/print head in place, I would imagine.\n\nLarge docs:  Not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...\n         manual says up to 100, though.  Haven\'t tried it.\n\nDrivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.  WinWord doesn\'t want to print\n         the envelopes the same way the Canon does, though.\n\nKnow nothing of add-on costs.\n\n Daniel A. Hartung  --  dhartung@chinet.chinet.com  --  Ask me about Rotaract\n\n===========================================================================\n\n>The deskjet is SLOW.  This is in comparison to the other printers I\n>mentioned.  I have no idea how the bubblejet compares.\n>\n>The interface between Win3.1 and the printer is just dandy, I\'ve not\n>had any problems with it.\n\nI just bought a BJ-200 printer a couple of days ago.  I compared it to the\nsample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn\'t for me.  The\nBJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  I can compare\nit with the HP LaserJet IIID PostScript and they look almost identical (\ndepending on the kind of paper).  I don\'t have problems with the ink not\nbeing dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.  Probably within a second.  Since\nCanon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of May, it is really a good buy.\n\n\n---\nSean Eckton\nComputer Support Representative\nCollege of Fine Arts and Communications\n\n===========================================================================\n\nWow, it\'s funny you should ask this.  I\'m a little behind in news reading\nso I know this may be late.\n\n  I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.  I was really worried\nthat I wouldn\'t like it but the print quality, and noise level is\nfantastic!  I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it\nprinted DAMN near laser quality.  You can\'t tell it\'s not laser unless you\nget 2 inches from the page.\n\n  no problems with drivers.  The printer came with the driver diskette\nwhich is good because I was beginning to panic when I couldn\'t findi it\nunder Windows or WordPerfect.  It works well under both.  I have yet to\ninstall Word for Windows so don\'t know how it works with them.\n\n  I had a DeskJet 500 at work last year.  It was a good printer as well ut\nI felt it was awfully slow.  And much noisier than the BubbleJet.  I won\'t\nsay the BubbleJet is MUCH better, but I really do like it more.  Just my\n$0.02 worth.\n\n-=- Brett\n===========================================================================\n\n--\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Kayman\t----\tkayman@cs.stanford.edu  -or-  cpa@cs.stanford.edu\n\n"In theory, theory and practice are the same.

aS'From: enzo@research.canon.oz.au (Enzo Liguori)\nSubject: Vandalizing the sky.\n\nFrom the article "What\'s New" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:\n\n........\nWHAT\'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC\n\n1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE "SPINOFFS" WE WERE PROMISED?\nIn 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published "The\nMan Who Sold the Moon," which involved a dispute over the sale of\nrights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this\n hideous vision of the future.  Observers were\nstartled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the\npad with "SCHWARZENEGGER" painted in huge block letters on the\nside of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged\nfor the ad to promote Arnold\'s latest movie. Now, Space Marketing\nis working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on\na plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth\norbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,\nsince NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates\n(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This\nmay look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of\nSpace Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the\nproject is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone\nmonitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.\n..........\n\nWhat do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize\nthe night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.\nWhat about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that\nit might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).\nIs NASA really supporting this junk?\nAre protesting groups being organized in the States?\nReally, really depressed.\n\n             Enzo\n-- \nVincenzo Liguori                             | enzo@research.canon.oz.au\nCanon Information Systems Research Australia | Phone +61 2 805 2983\nPO Box 313 NORTH RYDE NSW 2113               | Fax   +61 2 805 2929\n'

Snyder) writes:\n> I am looking for any information concerning projects involving Solar\n>  Sails. [...]\n> Are there any groups out there currently involved in such a project ?\n\nSure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They\'re listed in the sci.space\nFrequently Asked Questions file, which I\'ll excerpt.\n\n    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail\n    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend\n    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the\n    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth\n    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics\n    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,\n    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).\n\n\tWorld Space Foundation\n\tPost Office Box Y\n\tSouth Pasadena, California 91301\n\nWSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and\nnonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert\nStaehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.\n\nAlso there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,\na technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),\nand I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something\nto say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as\nquite a few references.\n\n\nCheck the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary\nSociety*:\n\nV36 p. 201-209 (1983)\nV36 p. 483-489 (1983)\nV37 p. 135-141 (1984)\nV37 p. 491-494 (1984)\nV38 p. 113-119 (1984)\nV38 p. 133-136 (1984)\n\n(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of\nreprints? I just found the file.)\n\nAnd K. Eric Drexler\'s paper "High Performance Solar Sails and Related\nReflecting Devices," AIAA paper 79-1418, probably in a book called\n*Space Manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the Second (?)\nConference on Space Manufacturing.  The 1979 one, at any rate.\n\nSubmarines, flying boats, robots, talking         Bill Higgins\npictures, radio, television, bouncing radar       Fermilab\nvibrations off the moon, rocket ships, and        HIGGINS@FNAL.BITNET\natom-splitting-- all in our time.  But nobody     HIGGINS@FNAL.FNAL.GOV\nhas yet been able to figure out a music           SPAN:  43011::HIGGINS\nholder for a marching piccolo player. \n                     --Meredith Willson, 1948\n'

aS'From: f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\nSubject: Disappointed by La Cie\n\nApproximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for\n$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were\nintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining\n5.41 wouldn\'t even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and\nexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.\n\nWell, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.\nOften, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I\nthen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive\nby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the\nIIsi and boot from the HD. I\'ve called La Cie again and they\'ve given me\nanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn\'t see\nthe drive there\'s a definite hardware problem.\n\nGiven that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send\nme a *new* one, but they said "no." Also, within three weeks after I purchased\nmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.\n\nI can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors\nmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And\nI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden\nprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these\nfacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that\nwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one\nthey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I\'ll have to again\nreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data\nrecovery.)\n\nIt seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a\ndiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still\ncovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. \n\nI feel a little helpless about all this. I don\'t mean to necessarily flame La\nCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.\nBut c\'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent\na letter to La Cie\'s customer service when the first drive was returned and I\nasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive\nthree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply\nthe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn\'t even \nhave the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? I\'m not sure. But I do know I won\'t buy any\nother products from La Cie in the future.\n\nBill Krauthammer\nf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu\n\nPS Please don\'t email or post about how good your La Cie product and service\nhas been. I\'m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like\nthat. All I\'m saying is that I\'ve had a disappointing experience with them and\nI\'ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.\n\n'

Look around in the real world people don't want\nto GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their \njob done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need \na computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the\nmultitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does\nthis and does it WELL.

Geez Allen any\norganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate\ncosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support\na program and "wrap" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap\nwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you\nsay is not true. Which is it Allen?\n\n>>>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate.

Apollo integration was \ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \nApollo?\n\n>Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs.

Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \n\n>>Kinda funny isn\'t it that someone who talks about a problem like this is\n>>at a place where everything is overhead.\n> \n>When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that\n>integration isn\'t overhead. It is the single most important part\n>of a successful large scale effort.\n>\n\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n>>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally\n>>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being \n>>selective with the facts again.\n> \n>The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on\n>Congress. Suprise suprise.

When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and\nwaits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an\nerror if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending\nAND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it\nwith their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very\nwell have different requirements.\n\nMy favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but\nalso run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD\nand DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through\nto SG.\n\nI have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it\nwith a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.\nThe advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.\n\nGordon Lang\n"

That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at \nRussian hardware.\n\nGoldin states NASA will present all options to the administration \nwhich will then have decision making power.\n\nGoldin and the White House have totally ruled out using Energia to\nboost the station.\n-- \nChuck Divine\n"

aS'From: MAILRP%ESA.BITNET@vm.gmd.de\nSubject: message from Space Digest\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Release No.19-93\nParis, 22 April 1993\n\nUsers of ESA\'s Olympus satellite report on the outcome of\ntheir experiments\n\n"Today Europe\'s space telecommunications sector would not\nbe blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided\na testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s". This\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\n\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\n       examples.\n\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\n\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\n\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\nworld\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\n\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\nof the world\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\norganisation.\n\n\n\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\nEUTELSAT.\n\nOLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,\nwhen the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the\nend of its design life.\n\n       \n'

It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball\nfloating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little\nadjustment jets to keep the ball away from them.

For example, is\n: >there a constant sensation of falling? \n\nRon Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) replied:\n: Yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  It may feel strange at first,\n: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that\n: of sky diving.\n\nI\'m no astronaut, but I\'ve flown in the KC-135 several times.  I\'ll\ntell you about my first flight.\n\nAt the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine\nstraightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab\nonto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)\nto prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my\ninvoluntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could\nfeel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while\nyou have a cold).\n\nAt that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,\nsince I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment\ngoing and keeping track of all the parts during the "return" of\ngravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn\'t really pay\nattention to physiology at that time.\n\nAfter about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one\nof the tricks I\'ve discovered to keep myself from getting motion\nsickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly\n-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,\nconcious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to\nparabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I\nhad to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically\nuseless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in\nthe back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just\nthis purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.\n(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous\npeople who don\'t get sick on the thing.)\n\nI didn\'t think of it as a "constant sensation of falling" so\nmuch as like swimming in air.  It\'s very close to the sensations\nI feel when I\'m scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.\n\nJerry:\n: >And what is the motion sickness\n: >that some astronauts occasionally experience? \n\nRon:\n: It is the body\'s reaction to a strange environment.  It appears to be\n: induced partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.\n: Some people are more prone to it than others, like some people are more\n: prone to get sick on a roller coaster ride than others.  The mental\n: part is usually induced by a lack of clear indication of which way is\n: up or down, ie: the Shuttle is normally oriented with its cargo bay\n: pointed towards Earth, so the Earth (or ground) is "above" the head of\n: the astronauts.  About 50% of the astronauts experience some form of\n: motion sickness, and NASA has done numerous tests in space to try to\n: see how to keep the number of occurances down.\n\nI\'m a volunteer in JSC\'s Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,\namong other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one\ncalled the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on\na several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual\naids.  The goal was to measure the victim\'s^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject\'s\nresponses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated\nexposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness\nsymptoms.\n\nJerry --\n\nI don\'t know of any former or active-duty astronauts who personally\nread this group.

Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a\nFault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal\ntelemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34\nmeter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into\nContingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry\nindicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers\nreported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes\nwere reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and\nAACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These\nreadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM\nyesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check\nfailure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be\ndetermining the precise cause over the next few days.\n\nAs of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial\nReference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to\ncommand the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.\n\nMagnetometer Calibration activities had completed prior to Contingency\nMode entry.  MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape\nRecorders 2 and 3.  Playback of DTRs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed\nyesterday, was postponed when Contingency Mode entry halted Flight\nSequence C9 execution.  The Flight Team is developing a strategy to restart\nC9 to complete data playback.  Present planning is to perform playbacks\nbetween  as soon as Wednesday, or as late as Friday of next week (5/5-\n5/7), dependent on Contingency Mode recovery activity.  DTR playback will\nbe performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits per second.

aS"Subject: ROCKET LAUNCH OBSERVED!\nFrom: leo.wikholm@compart.fi (Leo Wikholm)\n\n\n\n    A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland\n    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous\n    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near\n    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part\n    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They\n    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became\n    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle\n    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby\n    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were\n    visible till morning sunrise.\n\n    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in\n    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in\n    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was\n    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.\n    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a\n    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about\n    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the\n    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop\n    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of\n    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright\n    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails\n    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still\n    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.\n\n    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if\n    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near\n    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969\n    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of\n    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium\n    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we\n    have observed 17 satellite launches.\n\n    Leo Wikholm\n\n =====================================================================\n Ursa Astronomical Association        I phone : +358-0-174048\n Satellite and Rocket Phenomena Sect.

What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time\nthe video circuitry \'loses\' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the\nMac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video\ncircuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,\neven pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it\'s\npretty hard to hit menu items ;-)\nWe had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem\nhas been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has\nvaried. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the\ncache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not\nobviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU\nright?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did\nnot keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have\nhas this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,\nbut did it twice within an hour yesterday).\nThe technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty\nsharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had\npreviously tried ourselves anyway). These included:\n-swapping the RAM\n-swapping the VRAM\n-swapping monitors (3 different 13" Apple RGB and 2 16" Apple RGB)\n-swapping cables\n-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy\n-sacrificing various small mammals\nHere are some other facts:\n-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed\n (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)\n-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards\n that exhibit it in our lab\n-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards\n that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as\n faulty according to us.\nHere are some speculations:\n-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that\n much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do\n with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can\n reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).\n-the vendor\'s representative blames \'metal in your walls\' - claims that our\n walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac\'s operation. We\n have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it\'s not in\n the exact same spot....) Please don\'t tell me this is probably it, I do\n not want to believe it.\n-it\'s probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past\n security at the entrance to our site.\n\nHas anyone any ideas?

Note, too, that this is\ndone is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally\ncarefully coreographed and just what is going to be \'pushed\' and how\nfar is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,\nsuch as the \'early\' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed\ntaxi tests).\n\nI\'m sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about\nthis process (and then some).\n\n-- \n"Insisting on perfect safety is for people who don\'t have the balls to live\n in the real world."   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I don\'t speak for others and they don\'t speak for me.\n'

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your\ncalculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is\n307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I\ndon't think it is a BIOS mode.

I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out\nof town (in NM).\n\nAs for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work\non SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have\nsome. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital\nprototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for\nanother year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with\nmajor modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a\nset of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.\n\nBetter news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of\nthis program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next\nyear for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.\n\nNow not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made\nfor spending half on DC.\n\nPublic support is STILL critical.

Since standard colormaps\ntypically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid\ndisplacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one\nCLUT.\n\nI don\'t believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible\ncolormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,\ncolormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the\nsame standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a\nfull color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it\'s\ncalled under X11R5).\n\nIf you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default\ncolormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into\nthat colormap. If you can\'t do that, then you\'ll get flashing on a one\nhw CLUT framebuffer.\n\nNow if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your\nclient, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window\nmanagers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?\n-- \n\n   -paul\tpmartz@dsd.es.com\n\t\tEvans & Sutherland\n'

According to the latest MacLeak, the \ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\'t ask me what the \ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\'s PowerUser. The PLI\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\nreliable.  Personally, I\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \ngetting my hands on one.\n-Chris Wand\n\n-- \n\n"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity."\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\n'

In a recent\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\nsaid:\n\n  "There\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\'s."\n\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the "cracker" ethic, which is something\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \n\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\n\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers"\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\ncomputer industry?\n\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\n\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  "Revenge is a dish best served cold."       |\n|  "Szechuan Death"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\n|                             |            "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan"|\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n'

Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the\n  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your\n  authorization.\n    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the\n  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or\n  stty\'ing your terminal.\n\n  ---8<---\n  script for launching rlogin:\n    #!/bin/sh\n    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:\n    if [ -n "$DISPLAY" ]; then\n      case "$DISPLAY" in\n        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;\n      esac\n      TERM="$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`"\n      export TERM\n    fi\n    rlogin $*\n  ---8<---\n  add to your .cshrc or .login\n    if ( $?TERM ) then\n      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd \'&\'` != \'\' ) then\n        echo "$TERM" | cut \'-d&\' -f3 | xauth nmerge -\n        setenv DISPLAY `echo "$TERM" | cut \'-d&\' -f2`\n        setenv TERM    `echo "$TERM" | cut \'-d&\' -f1`\n      endif\n    endif\n  ---8<---\n  xterm command to use\n    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname\n  ---8<---\n\n3/ NFS.\n     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.\n   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization\n   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your\n   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means.

Lee) writes:\n>The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and\n>better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,\n>and (2) that DEC did.\n\nNo.  That\'s *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to\nsuggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the\nLynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My\ncomment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors\nthat supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.\n\nWhat I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that\nwe *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the\nCrimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.\n\nI\'m also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a\nprevious site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around\nfor a while, rather than being flushed.\n\nNow I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to\nkeep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself\npressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books\njust before the end of the quarter), but I\'m just a little tired of\ngetting boned in the process.\n\nMaybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\naren\'t entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,\nfor instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs\nand organizations, doesn\'t have a load of money to spend on computers\nevery year, so we can\'t be out buying new systems on a regular basis.\nThe boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the\nentire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That\nmeans that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I\nhave the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one\nprevious poster\'s words, \'to fill a niche\' to compete with some other\nvendor.  I\'m going to be looking at this box for the next five years.\nAnd every time I look at it, I\'m going to think about SGI and how I\ncould have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we\'re\nsupported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).\n\nNow you\'ll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a\ncorner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspl\n-- \nSteve Lamont, SciViGuy -- (619) 534-7968 -- spl@szechuan.ucsd.edu\nSan Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource/UC San Diego/La Jolla, CA 92093-0608\n"My other car is a car, too."\n                 - Bumper strip seen on I-805\n'

But we\'re also not going to promote pandering to\ncorporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don\'t *like*\ndealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the\nregistration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to\nbe solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour\nreinstall that\'s just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one\nway or another.\n\nSo, while I\'m not going to put much time into it myself, here\'s the\nprocedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:\n\n1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want\nto install it.  I\'ve been using c:\\WINSTALL myself.\n\n2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\\WINORIG.\n\n3.  Install from c:\\winstall.\n\n4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  \n    i.e., comp *.* \\winorig\\*.* >\\report.txt\n\n5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming\nthey didn\'t cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one\nfile should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate\nsaid offset in the original directory and see what\'s there using a hex\neditor, and do the same for the modified one.\n\n6.  You\'re on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don\'t\nreally do cryptography.  It\'s probably just an xor key or something; I\nthink MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing\nhis copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemble\nthe damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about\nany obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original\nfloppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able\nto back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a\ncompare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).\n\nAs I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and\ndon\'t do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one\ndirectory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff\nI\'ve mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if\nthey\'d ever find out.  If you aren\'t careful with the disk editor, you\ncould also mung something important... duh.

Please spread the word!  Here's some\ninformation about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay\nGoguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to\nlearn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have\nsome money available...\n\nJohn Spencer, 1993/04/21\n\nIapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn\nitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,\n(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;\n\n     1993 May 1-2\n\n        A-ring ingress  18:27\n               egress   19:30\n        B-ring ingress  19:51\n               egress   21:42\n        C-ring egress   23:00\n        Saturn ingress  23:59\n               egress   10:02\n        B-ring ingress  10:28\n               egress   12:19\n        A-ring ingress  12:40\n               egress   13:43\n\n     1993 July 20-21\n\n        Saturn ingress  21:16\n               egress   05:08\n        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)\n               egress   09:38\n\nTimes could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,\nand photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'\norbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from\nIapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about\nthe rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy\nand Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\nattention.\n\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\n\nJay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:\n\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\n\n  Jay\n\nand again:\n\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\n\njay\n\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n\n"

I \nfelt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor.\nThe NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard \ncomplaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control \nproblems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.\n\nThere was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not \nmatch up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the \nfrequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that \nthe NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter \nand the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable \npincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness \nwhen I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the \ncontrols.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the \nraster that tilted downhill.

aS"From: hurh@fnal.fnal.gov (Patrick Hurh)\nSubject: Cache Card and Optimum Memory Settings?\n\nHere's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped\nmyself and a few others:\n\nWhat does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large\ncache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?\n\nEX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't\nrob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). \nSay I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the\ncache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache\nbetween the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by\nproviding a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into\nthe SIMM RAM cache?\n\nI'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to\nreally do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar\nFastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some\noperations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM\naccesses?\n\nPlease help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci\nsystem described in the EX above.\n\n--patrick\nhurh@fnal.fnal.gov\n"

aS'From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock)\nSubject: Gibbons Outlines SSF Redesign Guidance\n\nNASA Headquarters distributed the following press\nrelease today (4/6). I\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\n\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\n\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President\'s new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n"full consideration" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, "President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation."\n\nNASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-\nWest Space Science Center at the University of Maryland\nunder the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.\n\n'

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\n\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\n\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\n\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\n\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\nmini-sequence.\n\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\n\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC\n\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\nRRA slew test.\n     ___    _____     ___\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\n    | | | |  __ \\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\n'

The tool survived\n the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot\n altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.\n\n    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,\n\n    "It\'s been a long time since something like this happened.  We\'ve\n lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."\n\n    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a\n Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on\n April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker\'s supervisor did not act on the\n report and Discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  NASA\n officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th\n launch date.\n\n    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB\n technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,\n its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a\n part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.\n|(Ron\'s ed. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)\n\n    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that\n the Shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".

aS'From: jayas@vast.unsw.edu.au (Jayasooriah)\nSubject: Experiences with DOS 6\n\n(I have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over\na week. If you do get multiple copies, my apologies.)\n\nHere is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the\npathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story\nbut would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the\npotential pitfalls of "upgrading" to DOS 6 that I have been able to\nnotice after only about a week of playing around with it.\n\nMy envorinment\n==============\n\nTI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk\nSystem BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments\nCL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel\nAdvance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments\nSmart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b-\nWindows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs\n\nAfter "updgrading" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things\nbecame so slow, especially after I decided to try \'dblspace\'.  In the\nprocess of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\n\n\nDisk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive\n==================================================\n\nWhile most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain\napplications appeared to run very much slower.  What was interesting is\nthat commands like \'chkdsk\' and \'defrag\' were running far too slowly to\nconsider them useful by any standards.  I suspected Double Space (DS)\nand decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\n\nThe Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from\nfactory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when "upgraded" to\nDOS 6 with DS.  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of\nmore than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew\nthat DS compression must cost something.\n\nSpecifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually\n*improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than\nI/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings\nin I/O cycles).  However, for all other cases, particularly large\nrandom writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\n\nWhile the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or\nsequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on\nWinBench\'s assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\n\nThe tests alone, done in \'real mode\' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv\non, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective\nstatements like \'there is no noticable difference in performance\' or\neven that \'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and\nslow disk I/O\'.\n\nThis explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why\n\'chkdsk\' and \'defrag\' (the latter especially) too so long.\n\n\nDouble Space and Windows\n========================\n\nDBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you\nwanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that\nmatter even check on its usage -- try "fasthelp dblspace" in a dos box\nwithin windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you\nget.  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\n\nYes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to\nfile manager, but this \'mstools\' dll does not understand a compressed\nfloppy!  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed\nfloppy if you dont know how to.)\n\n\nDOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM\n==============================================\n\nDefragmentation seemed to take too much time.  Even so, I waited\npatiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\nThis confirmation \'dblspace /def\' command for the 120M drive should take\nno more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used)\nbut it took 12 minutes.\n\nI discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran\nfaster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).  It dawned on me that this\nhad to do with TI\'s battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM)\nmodule which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle,\nand it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!  After\ndisabling the TI\'s power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\n\n\nMicrosft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots\n====================================================================\n\nIn the readme.txt file, you can find the the following\n\n\tRunning Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------\n\tTo avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup\n\tfor Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in\n\tyour CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you\n\trun Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\n\nIf you checked TI\'s manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it\nmeans "disable all power saving features of your notebook".  Why would\nanyone want to run a driver disabled!  As I have found out, not only\ndoes TI\'s power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the\nreadme.txt claims, but \'chkdsk\' and \'dblspace\' (and who knows what\nelse) are crippled by the TI\'s power saver.\n\nIt is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.  If\nthere indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI\nprogrammers dont know how to read these specifications.  You dont have\nto guess as to who are the idiots.\n\nBy the way, if you run the advance power management utility, POWER.EXE\nin DOS6, when you check the status, it says:\n\n\tPower Management Status\n\t-----------------------\n\tSetting =  ADV: MAX\n\tCPU: idle 60% of time.\n\nThis figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook\nwhen I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in\niconised form).  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all\nfor itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?  Is\nsuch an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating\nsystem or just another user interface)?  (In DOS alone, it reports 99%\nidle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type\nof package that I like my students to study as the classical \'negative\'\nexample of our times!\n\n\nMicrosoft programmers do not know batch programming\n===================================================\n\nI like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of\naddpath statements like this:\n\n\tset PATH=C:\\DOS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\BIN;%PATH%;C:\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=C:\\ETC\\WINDOWS;%PATH%;C:\\WINDOWS\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BCC\\BIN\n\t...\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\nEven though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old\none (i.e. c:\\dos), DOS 6 installation program modifes each and every\npath statement, and prepends C:\\DOS to its value.  As a result, my\nresultant path has so many DOS\'s.\n\nIf the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add\nthe new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement\ncontaing the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\n(Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a\ndirectory different from the old one being \'upgraded\'.)\n\nInstead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)\ndecided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and\nprepend DOS to the value.  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it\nwould not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\n\nI started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft\nrepresentative in Singapore called me about this poster.  In fact he\nspecifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the\ninformation to him as he did not have access to internet.\n\nNow that has not changed one bit.  In fact, if you have a PATH statement\nwith %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement\nshould not be touched for any reason?\n\nAs another example of the inability of Microsoft programmers to\nunderstand batch programming -- I had the mouse driver invoked as:\n\n\tset MOUSE=C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\n\tset PATH=%PATH%;%MOUSE%\n\tloadhigh %MOUSE%\\MOUSE.COM\n\nGuess what MEMMAKER did?  It replaced the last statement with\n\n\tLH ... C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\\MOUSE.COM\n\nWhy is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its\nparameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\n\n\nDOS 6 Software Quality\n======================\n\nDOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage,\nyou end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the\ncommands that come with it.\n\nI am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to\nuse all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.  If they dont\nwithin a week, I will post how you can create this "ghost" file.\n\nSurely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a\nparticular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot)\nprogrammers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find\nit -- that is what I was told how Microsoft "tests the quality" of\ntheir products.\n\nI think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to "test quality"\nwhen it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but\ncan only be built into the product.  No wonder they cannot provide any\nform of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs\nthat will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond\nrepair!\n\nAlso, if you run \'dblspace /def\' often enough, repeatedly when the disk\nis fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the\ndefragmenters.  I got my IO.SYS file size error and it got truncated\nwhen I did the chkdsk.  This happend only after five successive\ndefragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and\nwith no new file creation since.\n\nMicrosft, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you\nadmit that your DS has bugs, and are willing to let us know what we\nshould watch out for if we have already used DS.\n\nJaya\n\n--\nDr. Jayasooriah  CSE, CS&E, UNSW | Sign in a Paris hotel:                    \nP.O.

aS'From: mike@nx03.mik.uky.edu (Mike Mattone)\nSubject: LCD VGA display\n\nPlease help.\n\nI have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I\nwas working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,\nwhich I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and\nall peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.\n\nI left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was\ncompletely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still\nworked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what\nwas on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.\n\nI was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still\ntried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,\nall to no avail.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I\nneed to replace the screen then I guess I\'ll have to but I thought that the\n"death" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually\nhappened.  I didn\'t want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the\nnet about this because I already know what they\'ll say: "Yep, you gotta have\nthis replaced and it\'s gonna cost you $???."\n\nI\'ve only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life\ncycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the\nbrand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it\'s a 386SX @ 20 MHz.\nI forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down\nbefore coming in to work today.\n\nIf anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I\'m not\nopposed to having it replaced, but I\'d rather not if it\'s not absolutely\nnecessary.  If you wouldn\'t mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu\nbut if you\'d rather post I\'ll be checking back here in a couple of days.\n\nBTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel\nfree to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and\nname of the FAQ if you don\'t mind.\n\nThanks in advance for any help...\n\n-Mike Mattone\n(mike@mik.uky.edu) \n\n'

The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.\nThe structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect\nsome bubbling process is used to form it).

I suggest\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get "An Introduction to Ray\nTracing" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\n\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\'s another issue =^).  So, you\nget some illumination equation like this:\n\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\n\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\n\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\n\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\npurple-colored glass object.\n\n    Hopefully this answers your question.  I\'ll forward my "illumination\nequation sermon" to you also.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\nSteve Hollasch                                   Kubota Pacific Computer, Inc.\nhollasch@kpc.com                                 Santa Clara, California\n'

Uses VRAM.\n\nIn comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you\n  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.\n  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I\n  think it ends up costing more.\n\nGreg Dudek\n"

On the drawing you have a set of\nreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  \n\nNow you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron\nDanon\'s excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which\nconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click\nthe mouse.\n\nUpon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come\nout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways\nfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because the\nscanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are\nsuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and\ncontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,\nscanner errors and what have you.\n\nThe errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so "global"\nadjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or\nrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.\n\nSo the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for\nremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of\npoints \n\nReference(x,y) (the known true values)\n\nDistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)\n\nDistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)\n\nwhat function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to\nDistortedData to remove the errors.\n\nI suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted\nreference points as resulting from the projection of a "bumpy" 3d\nsurface, solving for the surface and then "flattening" it to remove\nthe errors in the other data points.\n\nAny kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,\npointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?\n\nThanks,\n\nEarl\n\n\n'

The NEC Adapter does\nnot do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into\nthe correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.\n\nDo I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??\n\nThe following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming\nthat the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);\n\n\nMacintosh LC to VGA\n \nThe Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA\nmonitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to\n16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported\nto 256 colors.\n \nNote:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level\n          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work\n          with the Macintosh LC.\n \nTo connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable\nfrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the\npinout description for the adapter cable:\n \nMacintosh LC        VGA\nVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name\n---------------     ----    -----------\n1                   6       Red ground\n2                   1       Red video signal\n5                   2       Green video signal\n6                   7       Green ground\n9                   3       Blue video signal\n13                  8       Blue ground\n15                  13      /HSYNC\n12                  14      /VSYNC\n14                  10      HSYNC ground\n7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together\n \nVGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC\nvideo connector.

A funny one I\nnoticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD\ncapability refer to the "auto inkjet" feature. This should have read "auto\ninject" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I\'ve seen from\nApple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess\nthat someone edited the copy, saw "inject" and thought it was a typo and\nchanged it to the more familiar word "inkjet".\n\nHmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of\n*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)\n'

You can generally tell the difference\njust by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,\nit's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're\nprobably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware\ncursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible\nthat the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually\nchecking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just \nthat.\n\nIn reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless\nof what the server returns.\n\n-joel\n"

There are three wires to control how you want turbo\nto become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think\nthe middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire\nconnects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two\nwires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate\ntwo wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.\n\nLED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which\nway the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,\nif the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the\nboard, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard\nis like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't\nlight, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.\n\nIf it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDan Moyer\nDan.Moyer@ColumbiaSC.NCR.COM \n\n"

aS"From: england@helix.nih.gov (Mad Vlad)\nSubject: Satellite Capabilities-Patriot Games\n\nHello netters,\n\n   I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place\nfor my post.  I have a question regarding satellite technology seen\nin the movie Patriot Games.  In the movies, the CIA utilizes its\norbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in N Africa.\nThe photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are\ncapable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My\nquestion is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the\nBritish SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was\nwatching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS\nwas clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at\nnight and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,\none could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.\nDoes such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., UV, IR,\nx-ray, etc.\n\nPS  Who wrote the book Patriot Games?\n\nMad Vlad\n"

Most of the C preprocessors that\n\tI have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n\tline.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n\tstart of a directive. \n\n\tHowever the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n\tas the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n\tthat "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n\timake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n\tfix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n\tuse of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n\tgives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp\'s\nthat behave similarly?\n\nSince I do not have easy access to News, a response to\n\'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com\' would be appreciated.\n'

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn\'t straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return\' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the "inet_" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don\'t involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found."\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn\'t work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has \'x\' where the cc version has \'i\', your \nfixincludes run didn\'t work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found "missing" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?\n\n\tThe R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add\nthese lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:\n        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)\n        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN\n        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN\n\n\tHowever, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so \nreferences to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the \nImakefile.

While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)\n\nThis is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in \nX11R4 (upon which OW 3.0\'s libXt is based).  It wasn\'t documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT\'s guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay.

Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O\'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey\'s article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard\'s working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can\'t I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with "_XtInherit not found" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror "ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can\'t share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif\'s 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn\'t need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can\'t I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n\t_XtTextReplace\n\n\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn\'t my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled "hints" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don\'t have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource \'*input:True\'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun\'s OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren\'t ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can\'t reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn\'t care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm\'s push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager\'s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to "test just \nthis one little thing" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib "Hello World" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable "sensitive" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget\'s man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don\'t XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou\'re probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions\' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets\' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn\'t be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn\'t there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe "new" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\nWhat should happen to the widget\'s children? And by the time such semantics are\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \ncreating a new widget.\n\n\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are:\n\n1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new?\n\n2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take?\n\n3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California).\n\n4. What is the most up-to-date version?\n\n5. Very important. How much would it be?\n\nThank you for your help.\n\n\nPaul.\n'

My\n>computer is a DTK 286-12 IBM clone.\n\nSimple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be\nsome confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use\nthe same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it\nis not possible to have both cards active at the same time.\n\nHere is an example.  For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."  I had a\ntape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It\'s an\n*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my\nmodem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and\nthe tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt\nhandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate\nan interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape\ncontroller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would\nmost likely "hang.")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it\ninstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won\'t do anything for\nthe serial port.\n\nUnder DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the\nstatus of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.\nThat\'s why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.\nTry that on NT and see how far you\'ll get. :-)\n-- \nKenneth R.

Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.\n\n\nEquatorial radar system\nFUKAO, SHOICHIRO;  TSUDA, TOSHITAKA; SATO, TORU; KATO, SUSUMU\n(Kyoto University, Uji, Japan)\n(COSPAR, IAGA, SCOSTEP, et al., Plenary Meeting, 27th,\nWorkshops and Symposium on the Earth's Middle Atmosphere,\nEspoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research\n(ISSN 0273-1177), vol. 10, no. 10, 1990, p. 151-154.\n     A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent \nscatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 \nkm altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in \nPontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The \nsystem is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array \nconfiguration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been \nin successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about \n3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective \nantenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of \nthe MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam \nsteering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, \na variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of \nthe radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration \nis presented. \n\n"

The problems you present are exist anyway,\nand I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such\nproblems to my programs in the first place.\n\nGamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image\nas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image\nback to 24 bit image.\n\n\n>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How\n>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global\n>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and\n>>>much more complicated.\n\nOk, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit\nand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,\njumps off the discussion a bit.\n\nMy solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit\nimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.\n\n\nAbout changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image.\nXV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the\nmentioned type images.\n\nMoreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\nchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\npaint program job.\nIf person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\noriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\n\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\n\n\n>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\n\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\ndesigned for that.\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\nprogram work -- design error.\n\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\nmajor change to the original design.\n\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\n\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\n\n\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\nread it.\n\n\nJuhana Kouhia\n"

On-orbit, SSME\'s are just dead weight, since we don\'t have an\nSSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means\nthat you can\'t use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has\na couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.\n\nThrow-away SSME\'s might let us use some of the old SSME\'s which are not-\nquite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we\'d do that; the cost of a launch\nfailure is too high.\n\n-- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office\n      kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368\n\n     "...Development of the space station is as inevitable as \n      the rising of the sun." -- Wernher von Braun\n'

We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI\nUltra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the\nWindows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit\nmodes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,\nand within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally\nunintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire\nabout this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it\nwas version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for\nthe ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I\'m simply\namazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected\nto see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).\n\nOne very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none\nof the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers\nfor Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I\'ve been\nrunning a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have\ntested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:\n"Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I\njust wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about\nit.

This is\na fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is\npossible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for\na cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using\nthe SM, pray tell?\n\nThe correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can\ncarry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly\nto the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the\npolitically correct thing, but from the developers' point of\nview it is.\n\n\nChrister Ericson --- Internet: christer@cs.umu.se --- tel: +46-90-166794\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Umea, S-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN\n"

aS'Subject: Space FAQ 01/15 - Introduction\nFrom: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech)\n\nArchive-name: space/intro\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $\n\n    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO\n\n    INTRODUCTION\n\n    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet\ngroups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to\nfrequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth\npreserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don\'t want to see the FAQ, add \'Frequently Asked Questions\' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\'re not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\'re out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\'re on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit "Subject:" lines, especially if you\'re taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n\t100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n\tnot SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n\treferences.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\'re\n\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\'t assume the\n\t\'reply\' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\'t post what everyone\n\twill get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n\t(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\'t\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\n    posting. Only those containing astronomy-related material are posted to\n    sci.astro (indicated by \'*\' following the posting number).\n\n    #\tContents\n\n    1*\tIntroduction\n\t    Suggestions for better netiquette\n\t    Index to linked postings\n\t    Notes on addresses, phone numbers, etc.\n\t    Contributors\n\n    2*\tNetwork resources\n\t    Overview\n\t    Mailing lists\n\t    Periodically updated information\n\t    Warning about non-public networks\n\n    3*\tOnline (and some offline) sources of images, data, etc.\n\t    Introduction\n\t    Viewing Images\n\t    Online Archives\n\t\tNASA Ames\n\t\tNASA Astrophysics Data System\n\t\tNASA Jet Propulsion Lab (Mission Information and Images)\n\t\tNASA Langley (Technical Reports)\n\t\tNASA Spacelink\n\t\tNational Space Science Data Center\n\t\tSpace Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

aS'From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock)\nSubject: NASA "Wraps"\n\nIn the April edition of "One Small Step for a Space Activist",\nAllen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write:\n  "Another problem is what are called \'wraps\' (or sometimes\n   the \'center tax\'). When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won\'t be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\'t), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term \'center tax\'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else."\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\'t post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\'m supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \'center tax\', or \'wrap\' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \'tax\'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter \'taxes\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\'t if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don\'t have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it\'s only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question "What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don\'t go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\'t eaten\nup by the center tax?)"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my \'home\' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the \'tax\' does not all\ngo into a \'slush fund.\' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \'general\'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn\'t go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is \'billable\' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!\n\nMy last point is that I can\'t believe your claim that\nCongress has never heard of the term \'center tax.\'\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\nCongress isn\'t on a computer, so I can\'t do a simple\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,\nin some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods\nwere documented for Congress?\n'

(like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...\n\nyou can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...\nalso animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)\nalso animted reflections maps....\n\nyou get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...\n\ndont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it\ncomes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!\n\nalso....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list??\nplease e-mail me if you do or post up here....\n\noh...the number for IMPULSE is --->1 800 328 0184\n\ntrb3@ra.msstate.edu\n\n"

On our network, people\nhave 7.0, 7.01, and 7.1 versions of the Laserwriter print driver.  We have\nbeen solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver, but it is\ntime-consuming and a real pain.\n\nThe Printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently.  We have also\njust been replacing it (over and over, it seems) to keep things running.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing\nsoftware to go bad?

SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.\n\nA SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data\nfrom the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data\nand moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate\neven better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape\nunits.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is\nissued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other\ndevices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do\nsomething else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be\nwhat I am doing while reading this group.\n\nIts a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,\nthanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is\nbetter standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to\ncompletely get rid of IDE.\n--\n  Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.\n  Palm Bay, FL.

Modern, \n: ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed\n: orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: The\n: opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have\n: driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based\n: telescopes.\n\nHardly.  The Keck telescope in Hawaii has taken its first pictures; they\'re\nnearly as good as Hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\n: In any case, a bright point of light passing through\n: the field doesn\'t ruin observations. If that were the case, the\n: thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets\n: might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,\n: they are extremely bright.)\n\nI believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;\nmore like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all\nover the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.\n\nThis is a known problem, but of course two weeks out of every four are\nOK.  What happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes?

Does he have to use new\nparts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your\nknowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty\nbut he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? \n\nWhen it comes to local dealers:\n\n- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" are\nre-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.\n\n- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.\n\n- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done\nperiod, unless you are on a paid service contract.\n\nHaving been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a\nComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what\nI\'m talking about. \n\nI also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like\nto push when they\'re selling.  It\'s that same old song that car dealers\nhaving been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you\'ll get good\nservice. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition\nand you\'ll be sorry if you need service." \n\nExperienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order\ncompanies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, \non-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you\ngood service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good \nservice, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point, \nbut I\'m sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.\n\n- Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)\n'

If I forgot or botched your\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\'s an acronym *not*\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\nit out, I\'ll add it to the list.\n\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\n\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\n\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\'re on your\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\nare essentially always explained as they\'re introduced are omitted.\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\'re simply\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\n\nThanks to everybody who\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\n\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\n\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have\nroughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell\nfile servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our\nEthernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each\nsegment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run\nwere very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.\n\nBut the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486\n33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have\n10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns\nbecause you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will\nattempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time\nslice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.\n\nHaving said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding\nin calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of\nthing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before\nyou started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).\nIt all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going\nto see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all\ndoing network things also...)\n-- \n       Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels\n Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com\n  BBS: (310) 314-3227 * FAX: (310) 314-3217 * Compuserve: GO QUARTERDECK\n   Q/Fax: (310) 314-3214 from touch-tone phone for Technotes On Demand!\n"

I believe\nthat X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics\nand displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my\npath, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but\nnot for the family I am using (Helvetica).\n\nI think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the\nresolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you\nexplicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the\nscaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command\n\nxfd -fn \'-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*\'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).\n\nThe command  \n\nxfd -fn \'-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*\'\n\nWill invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).\nDespite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can\ngenerate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a\nresolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.\n\nIs this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can\ndo to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about\nmy resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).\nThis would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to\nlook at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats\nan inch".

Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected\nlocal authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable\nsuccess in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At\nleast, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.\n( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )\n\nI suppose that the "right" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,\nbut it is a worthwhile one.

aS'From: Cohen@ssdgwy.mdc.com (Andy Cohen)\nSubject: Report on redesign team\n\nThe following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,\nbut there are a number of items not seen here yet.....\n\nRedesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,\nbased on information provided by NASA headquarters.\n\nThe station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the\nAdvisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\n\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\n\n\xa5 Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\nsystems such as the so-called "Bus-1 spacecraft," the orbiter and Spacelab.\n\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\n\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\n\n\xa5 Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\nManagement System.\n\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\n\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\n\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\n\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\npropulsion systems.\n\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\n\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\noperations costs, he said.\n\n\xa5 Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\n\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 "decks" connected by a\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\nmodules, and other elements.  This "can" would have two fixed photo voltaic\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\nattitude.\n\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\'Connor\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\n\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\n\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\n\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\nmanagement options have been developed including:\n\n\xa5 Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\ncommand.\n\n\xa5 Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\nAdministrator.\n\n\xa5 Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\nhand-picked program office.\n\n\xa5 Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\nelement of the current program.\n\n\xa5 Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\n\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\n\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\nand ground operations.\n\nWhat\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be "frozen" to begin the\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\nbe held May 3.\n\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\'Connor will take over the\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\nconsult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request\nfrom Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.\n\nKey Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being\ncarried on the schedule are:\n\nApril 26\nDesign Freeze on Options for Costing\n\nApril 27\nDesign Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT\n\nMay 3\nStatus report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nMay 15\nInterim report by Redesign Advisory Committee\n\nJune 7\nFinal report to Redesign Advisory Committee\n\n\n(Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)\n \n'

However, just in case\nsomething went wrong, I\'m going to describe some of the changes needed\nto get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed\nthat installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when\nyou\'re not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in\nthe section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".\n\n\n* MSDOS configuration:\n\n     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,\nyou\'ll notice that you\'ll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive\n(this is the default setup).  You\'ll also notice that your system runs\nmuch, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section\ncalled, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system\nup.\n\n\n* Windows configuration:\n\n     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the\n"[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\nI believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry\nto SYSTEM.INI, but I\'m not sure.  If this doesn\'t work for you, you\nmight want to try adding some more lines:\n\n\tVirtualHDIRQ=Off\n\tSystemROMBreakPoint=false\n\tEMMExclude=A000-CFFF\n\n(You probably don\'t need the above lines, though.)  The\n"SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory\nmanagers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).\n\n\n* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:\n\n     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that\nyour system is running much slower than before.  If it\'s not, it\'s\nprobably because:\n\n     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your\n\tCONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a\n\twinning solution.\n\n     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to\n\tbe seen ....\n\nIf your system is running much slower than before, this is almost\ndefinitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the\nWindows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808\n("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use\nSmartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really\nslows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a\nfactor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other\nsolutions.\n\n     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you\ndo, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even\ndestroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.\nWhat you can do is one of the following:\n\n     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my\n\topinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused\n\teither by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in\n\tSmartdrive.\n\n     2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for\n\t"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported\n\tby Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like\n\tthe 1542) to work with Windows.\n\n     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following\nsolutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I\nam now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused\nby these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following\ndoes not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is\nstrongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:\n\n1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI\n   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two\n   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your\n   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into\n   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies\n   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be\n   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it\'s\n   still there).\n\n2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version\n   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers\n   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:\n\n\tDRIVER=c:\\ASPI4DOS.SYS\n\tDRIVER=c:\\SCSIHA.SYS /V386\n\n   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high\n   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would\n   crash my system, but it doesn\'t.  I asked Adaptec\'s technical support\n   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine\n   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.\n\n   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would\n   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting\n   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my\n   C:\\WINDOWS\\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes\n   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE\n   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason\n   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.\n\n   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of\n   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.\n\n   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without\n   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider\n   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.\n\n3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is\n   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer\n   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS\n   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not\n   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only\n   three ways to get a copy:\n\n      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver\n\tkit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other\n\tdrivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is\n\taround $75.\n\n      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you\n\tcan supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for\n\taround $30.\n\n      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0\n\tfor MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in\n\tdifferent directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is\n\tincluded; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two\n\thard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy\n\tof ASPI4DOS 3.1.\n\nNote, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with\nWindows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing\nthis, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above\nsolutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk\naccesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the\nparity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off\ntiming for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I\'ve run various\nmemory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no\nproblems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal\ntiming requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers\n(this is why the memory tests didn\'t find any problems -- the problems\nshow up only under disk I/O).  However, I\'m mentioning this just in case\nit isn\'t a hardware problem.\n\n\n***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:\n\n     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a\nfloppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory\nSystems Jumbo 250:\n\n1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive\n   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.\n\n2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.\n   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.\n   However, I\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so\n   I\'m mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my\n   1542.)\n\n\n* Tape backups/restores take a long time:\n\n     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may\nhave to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best\nresults when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup\nor restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with\nonly an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the\nAdaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,\nstart and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the\ntape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective\ntape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).\nThis also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer\nthan necessary.\n\n     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to\ntransfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA\nto transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs\nto feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is\nnot fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,\nrewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).\nThe default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is\n"too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be\ntransferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the\ntape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too\nmuch (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to\nmemory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the\ntape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,\nbecause data is not fed to it quickly enough.\n\n     The solution is to change the Adaptec\'s bus on/off timing.  The\ndefault factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.\nThe "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can\nbe done in one of two ways:\n\n* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use\n  a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the\n  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tDEVICE=c:\\aspi4dos.sys /n4\n\n  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".\n\n* If you don\'t have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a\n  program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The\n  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to\n  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for\n  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have\n  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to\n  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have\n  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:\n\n\tsetscsi -n:4\n\n  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running\n  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the\n  factory defaults.\n\n  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use\n  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I\n  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.\n\nDo not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it\nabove 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk\nthroughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4\nmicroseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may\nhave to adjust it downwards a little.\n\n     Once you\'ve lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores\nshould run faster.\n\n     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other\noptions that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what\nyou are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by\nstarving memory refresh.\n\n     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless\nthis has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),\nthis is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple\nof other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the\nbus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried\nrunning this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I\nwas running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn\'t check to see if there was a\nconflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,\nalthough the docs say that it works with the 1542A?\n\n\n* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:\n\n     This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my\nsystem, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.\nHowever, I\'ve heard of other people having similar problems, and so I\'m\nmentioning this just in case it isn\'t a hardware problem just on my\n1542.\n\n     Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the\ntape head:\n\n1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,\n   resulting in an aborted tape backup.\n\n2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.\n\n3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.\n   Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a\n   long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,\n   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.\n\n4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other\n   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software\n   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the\n   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.\n\n5. Too many tape read errors.\n\n     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered\nthat using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I\nupgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy\ncontroller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I\ninitially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I\ndecided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on\nthe motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)\nreliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly\nable to find and use the tape drive.\n\n     I don\'t know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.\nOn the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached\nto the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the\n1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn\'t work well attached to\nthe 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different\ncontroller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my\n1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that\nthe problem was in the cables.  I don\'t know what the cause really is;\nhowever, if you\'re having similar problems, you might want to consider\ntrying a new floppy controller.\n\n\n***** Sound cards:\n\n     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and\nthis is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the\nAdaptec\'s DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the\ntape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error\n(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is\nthat, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the\nAdaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a\nparity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a\nhardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity\nerror is not a symptom of bad hardware.\n\n     I\'ve found that such parity errors typically occur while recording\ndigitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase\nthe recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,\nrecording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).\n\n     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the\nAdaptec\'s "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for\ninformation on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may\nnot solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity\nerror.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect\nthis problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the\nspeed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also\naffect this.\n\n\n***** Miscellaneous info:\n\n     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much\nof it is merely information that I\'ve heard or read about, and have not\nverified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I\'m\nnot sure.  Use it at your own risk.\n\n* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="\n  parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.\n  If you don\'t, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM\n  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that\n  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM\n  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install\n  program -- I haven\'t tested any other version).  Earlier versions of\n  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I\'m not sure (I\'ve never used a\n  version earlier than 6.00).\n\n  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.\n\n* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one\n  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you\n  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I\'m not sure if this is\n  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.\n\n* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and\n  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces\n  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three\n  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following\n  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand\n  information):\n\n     1. You can buy Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for\n\tsomething like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,\n\tyou can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact\n\tAdaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains\n\teverything that you need.\n\n     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the\n\tsame people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM\n\tdrivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know\n\tthe list price, but I\'ve seen this package sold for around\n\t$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS\n\tdriver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,\n\tyou may be better off getting Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI instead.\n\n     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been\n\tobsoleted by Adaptec\'s EZ SCSI kit, but I\'m mentioning it in\n\tcase someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the\n\tdrivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410\n\tkit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of\n\tMSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in\n\tthe ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin\n\tboards.\n\n* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows\n  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I\'ve heard about are\n  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how\n  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the\n  following is secondhand information):\n\n     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large\n\tnumber of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers\n\t(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.\n\n     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup\n\tprogram (see the above section on CDROM drives for more\n\tdetails).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but\n\trequires, ASPI4DOS.\n\n* I\'ve seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:\n\n     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.\n     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.\n     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and\n\tCorelSCSI! drivers/programs.\n\n  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:\n\n     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI\n\tdrivers).\n\n* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar\n  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you\n  need this driver before you can use this program).  I\'ve never used\n  this version of GNU tar, but I\'ve heard that it works (I don\'t know\n  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,\n  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:\n\n\tPD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>\n\tASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx\n\tASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10\n\tASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr\n\n  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might\n  have it, if any forum does.\n\n* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are\n  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.\n  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and\n  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work\n  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of\n  BSD Unix).\n\n* In case anyone\'s curious, here\'s an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  Note that I\'m using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS\n  3.0 or 3.0a, I\'d probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  If I weren\'t using ASPI4DOS, I\'d probably use something that looked\n  like:\n\n\tFILES=40\n\tBUFFERS=40\n\tBREAK=ON\n\tSTACKS=10,256\n\tDEVICE=c:\\sys\\dev\\scsiha.sys /V386\n\tDEVICE=C:\\QEMM\\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF\n\tDOS=HIGH,UMB\n\tDEVICEHIGH=c:\\sys\\dev\\nnansi.sys\n\tDEVICEHIGH=C:\\DOS\\SETVER.EXE\n\tshell = c:\\dos\\command.com /p\n\n  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I\n  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still\n  need some way of changing the Adaptec\'s bus on/off times.

It has an access of 200ms and a data\ntransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is\navailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two\nmail in coupons for two free CDs.  I\'m not sure if the cd\'s are good, since\nI\'ve only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd\'s shipped\nto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The\nCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,\nwhich supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to\nattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the\nCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly\nlower price with two free CDs.\n\nThe Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I\nthink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the\nthree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple\ncatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo\ncd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of\nwhich are pretty good.\n\nThe NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and\na data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around\n$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn\'t multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible\nbefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of\nthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd\'s\nunless you buy it in a bundle.\n\nOf the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the\nApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it\'s\ncompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it\'s\nspeed and performance. \n\nBTW, the models of the drives are:\n\nApple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)\n\nCD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I\'m not sure, but it\nis also something like with 3401)\n\nNEC:  CDR-74\n\n\nI\'m very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems\nwhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am\npretty sure of myself, even when I think I\'m not.\n\nAlso, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as\nthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,\nmy hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is\njust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the\nenormous chinese community.

We wanted to talk to the internet with the mail\npackage so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transport\npackage on top of that which is utterly stupid but that\'s what they\nrequire to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pc\nfor the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another\ndedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mail\ngoing but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  \n\nThere is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don\'t know if it\nis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the\nmail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a\nUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail\nis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.\nMost messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail\non the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.\nWhere ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header\nthen a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".  If you\ncan stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people\nof course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably\nthe problem.

In general, it feels *FAST*, although this\nis the first VLB card that I have tried.  Still, the results are \nimpressive.\n\nWith my 486DX2/66 w/16 MB, running at 1024x768/256, I\'ve had the following\nWinTach 1.0 results:\n\n\nCard\t\t\t\tWP\tCAD\tSpread\tPaint\tOverall\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nATI Graphics Ultra\t\t13.5\t14.5\t19.1\t25.0\t18.0\nATI Ultra+ (no aperture)\t11.2\t13.8\t10.7\t20.9\t14.1\nHercules Graphite VL\t\t16.1\t67.8\t41.4\t52.8\t44.5\n\nUnfortunately I don\'t have the numbers here, but the ATI Ultra Pro VLB\nhad an overall WinTach score of about 26.  The Ultra Pro was nearly as\nfast in text handling, but was blown away in the CAD and Paint tests.\n\nAs an additional test, we hand-timed a complex CorelDraw! slide resize/-\nredraw times.  There was no swapping, but I\'d expect there is a fairly\nheavy load on the CPU.  The Graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2\nseconds, with ATI Ultra Pro at 12.0.  This jives with Steve Gibson\'s\ncontention that the ISA Graphite is faster than an ATI UP on his complex\nMicrografx Draw document.\n\nSo far, I\'m *very* impressed.  The drivers look solid, and the card flies.\nThe installation and utilities are different, but comparable to ATI\'s.  And\nI didn\'t have to wait for Build 59 for some reliability...  With Hercules\'\nsoftware developer special, you can get an evaluation copy of the card for\njust $225 (or $200 for the ISA version).

This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It\'s a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one\'s $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    "An Album of Map Projections", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

aS'From: goltz@mimi.UU.NET (James P. Goltz)\nSubject: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?\n\n\n  Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It\nwould be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.\nThe idea was that you\'d detonate devices with somewhere from one to\nten megatons yield behind a "pusher plate" attached to the main\nspacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer\nmomentum to the ship.\n\n  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion\nheats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave\ninto the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are\ngoing to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,\nhelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic\nradiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission\nproducts).\n\n  Would this work?  I can\'t see the EM radiation impelling very much\nmomentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems\nto me you\'re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs\nout the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once\nthey\'re there.\n\n  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?\n\n  Thanks.\n\n-- \n\t--Jim\n\n---\nJim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net\n'

The number of characters\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\nX\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\nX\nX---entry---\nXrule:\t1993\nXfix:\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\nXtitle:\ttitle of entry  \t\t    (see comments below)\nXentry:\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\nXdate:\tDate/time of submission in UTC\t    (see comments below)\nXhost:\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\nX\tUse tab indented lines if needed\nX---remark---\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\nX---author---\nXname:\tyour name\nXorg:\tSchool/Company/Organization\nXaddr:\tpostal address\nX\tuse tab indented lines to continue\nX\tdon\'t forget to include the country\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\nXanon:\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\nX---info---\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\nX---build---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named \'build\'.  The resulting\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\nX---program---\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\nXinto a file named is \'prog.c\'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\nX---end---\nX\nX      Regarding the above format:\nX\nX\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\nX\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\nX\nX\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\nX\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\nX\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\nX\nX\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\nX\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \nX\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\nX\nX\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\nX\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set \'fix\' in the \nX\t  ---entry--- section to \'n\'.  The corrected entry must use the same \nX\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \nX\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\nX\nX\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \nX\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\nX\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\nX\t  Email message to the judges.\nX\nX\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \nX\t  \'y\' was given to the respective author\'s \'anon\' line.\nX\nX\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\nX\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\nX\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\nX\nX\t* The entry\'s remarks should include:\nX\t    - what this program does\nX\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\nX\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\nX\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\nX\t    - information about any ---data--- files\nX\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\nX\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\nX\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\nX\nX\t* Do not rot13 your entry\'s remarks.  You may suggest that certain\nX\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\nX\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \nX\t  should not be required to exist.\nX\nX\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\nX\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \nX\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\nX\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\nX\nX\t   \'build\' is incorporated into a makefile, and \'build\' is removed\nX\t   \'prog.c\' is renamed to your entry\'s title, followed by an optional\nX\t       digit, followed by \'.c\'\nX\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry\'s\nX\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\nX\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\nX       entry\'s remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\nX       build shell script containing the \'build\' information.  The name of\nX       this build shell script will be your entry\'s title, possibly followed\nX       by a digit, followed by \'.sh\'.\nX\nX       If needed, your entry\'s remarks should indicate how your entry must\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\nX\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\nX       occurs, state so in your entry\'s remarks.\nX\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\nX\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is\nX       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:\nX\nX\t\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate\nX\t\tobfuscate@toad.com\nX\nX       We request that your message use the subject \'ioccc entry\'.\nX\nX       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries\nX       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.\nX       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for\nX       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.\nX\nX    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry\nX       must be sent in a separate Email letter.\nX\nX   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  \nX       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.\nX\nX   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,\nX       special owner or group) are not allowed.\nX    \nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\nX\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\nX\nX\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\nX\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\nX\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\nX\nX\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\nX\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\nX\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\nX    might be \'old\' the next year.\nX\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\nX\nX\t* look at the original source\nX\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \'#include\' lines\nX\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \'#define\' and \'#include\' lines\nX\t* run it through a C beautifier\nX\t* examine the algorithm\nX\t* lint it\nX\t* compile it\nX\t* execute it\nX\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\nX    \'cleaned up\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\nX\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\nX    \'strangest/most creative source layout\' need not do as well as\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\nX\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \'worst abuse of the\nX    rules\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\nX\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\nX    annoy more than amuse.\nX\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \'worst abuse of the rules\'\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\nX\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\'t work.\nX\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\nX    documenting it.  Noting "this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\nX    of a prime by mistake" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\nX    working entry is best.\nX\nX\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\nX\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \'old\'.  We\nX    tend to \'see thru\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\'t go as far\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\nX\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\nX\nX\t#define d define\nX\t#d foo\t\t   <-- don\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tj;\t\t   <-- don\'t use such implicit type declaration\nX\tint k;\nX\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\nX\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\nX\nX\tint i;\nX\tchar *c;\nX\ti[c];\t\t   <--- use c[i] instead\nX\t(i+3)["string"];   <--- use "string"[i+3] instead\nX\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\nX    not portable and must not be used:\nX\nX\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\nX\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\nX\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\nX\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\nX\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\nX\t* using va_list as a structure or union\nX\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\'s.\nX\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\nX\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\nX    the leading \'#\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \'#\', many do not.\nX\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\nX\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\nX\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\nX\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\nX\nX\t* are very hardware specific\nX\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\nX\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\nX\t      code is likely not to be)\nX\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\nX\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \'remark\' header item)\nX\t* won\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\nX\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\nX\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\nX\t* are longer than they need to be\nX\t* are similar to previous winners\nX\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\nX\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\nX    \'best one liner\' category, we suggest that you format your program\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\nX\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\'s to help out,\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\'s in order to\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\nX\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\nX\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\nX\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \'smallest self-replicating\'\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \'smallest\', lest we (or others)\nX    know of a smaller one!\nX\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\'t\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\'t depend\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\'t require backing store.\nX\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\nX    Don\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\nX\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    We like programs that:\nX\nX\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\nX\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\nX\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\nX\t* are portable\nX\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\nX\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\nX\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\nX\nX    Some types of programs can\'t excel in some areas.  Of course, your\nX    program doesn\'t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\nX    areas really does help.\nX\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\nX\nX    Be creative!\nX\nX\nXENTRY FORMAT:\nX\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\nX\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\nX\nX\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\nX\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\nX\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\nX\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\nX\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\nX\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\nX\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.

If an entry wins, we will rename\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\nX    we use the name of the entry\'s title, followed by an optional\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\nX\nX    If the above entry somehow won the \'least likely to win\' award,\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\nX\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\nX    if you did one of the following:\nX\nX\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\nX\nX\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\nX\nX\t\tcc prog.c -o special_name\t\tneed special binary\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\t\t\tneed special source\nX\t\tcp prog.c special_src.c\nX\t\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\nX\nX\t    or  rm -f special_build\t\t\tneed special build\nX\t\ttail +4 build > special_build\nX\t\tsh < special_build\nX\nX\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \nX\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \nX\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\nX\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\nX\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\nX\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\nX    \'hints\' file.\nX\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\nX\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\nX\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\nX    have entry number 0.\nX\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\'t place text outside of the\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\'t\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX    \nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\nX\nX\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\nX\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many \nX    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:\nX\nX\tdate -u "+%a %h %d %T 19%y"\nX\tdate -u | sed -e \'s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\'\nX\tsh -c \'TZ=UTC date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"\'\nX\tsh -c \'TZ=GMT date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"\'\nX\tsh -c \'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e "s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/"\'\nX\nX    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set\nX    the \'fix\' line in the ---entry--- section to \'y\' instead of \'n\'.\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\nX    replaced.\nX\nX\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\nX\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\nX\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\nX\nX\t---entry--- section\nX\tall ---author--- sections\nX\tall ---info--- sections\nX\t---build--- section\nX\t---program--- section\nX\tany other text, including the Email message headers\nX\nX    Prior to judging, the \'any other text\' file is scanned to be sure\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\nX\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\nX\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\nX    Because the main \'prize\' of winning is being announced, we make all\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\nX    winners at talks)\nX\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\nX\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\nX\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\nX\nX\t* reading the ---entry--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\nX\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\nX\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\nX\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\nX\t    shipping over any #include files\nX\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\nX\nX\t* linting the source\nX\t* compiling/building the source\nX\t* running the program\nX\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\nX\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\nX\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\nX\nX\t* best small one line program\nX\t* best small program\nX\t* strangest/most creative source layout\nX\t* most useful obfuscated program\nX\t* best game that is obfuscated\nX\t* most creatively obfuscated program\nX\t* most deceptive C code\nX\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\nX\t* best abuse of ANSI C\nX\t* worst abuse of the rules\nX\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\nX\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\nX\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\nX    less clear cut.\nX\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\nX\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\nX    rules in some way.\nX\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \'best\'.  Sometimes such\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\nX    \'best\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\nX\nX\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\nX\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\nX\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\nX\nX\t    comp.lang.c\t\t  comp.unix.wizards\talt.sources\nX\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\nX\nX\t    comp.sources.d\t  alt.sources.d\t\tmisc.misc\nX\t    comp.sources.misc\t  comp.windows.x\nX\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See\nX    below for details.\nX\nX    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners \nX    have appeared in books ("The New Hackers Dictionary") and on T-Shirts.\nX\nX    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)\nX\nX\nXFOR MORE INFORMATION:\nX\nX    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address:\nX\nX\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\t(not the address for\nX\tjudges@toad.com\t\t\t\t\t submitting entries)\nX\nX    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome.\nX\nX    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry\nX    program.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and\nthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.\n\tIn general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating \nindependently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other\ncallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be \nregistered can explicitly call other functions necessary.\n\n[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 122)  Why doesn\'t XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?\n\n\tXtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving\ndangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not \nactually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?\n\t\n\tIt is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,\nwhich has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer\nis set to one of the valid values. If it is not a "yes" answer, the code drops\nout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: \n\n\tvoid quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)\n\t{\n\t\tint             answer;\n\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, "Really Quit?");\n\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\tanswer = AskUser(w, "Are You Really Positive?");\n\t\t\tif (RET_YES == answer)\n\t\t\t\texit(0);\n                }\n\t}\n\n\tA more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether \nto overwrite it.\n\tThis is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and\nwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the\ncalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the \nMotif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of \ndialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for "OK", "Cancel" and \n"Help" or equivalents:\n\n  int AskUser(w, string)\n        Widget          w;\n        char           *string;\n  {\n        int             answer=RET_NONE;\t/* some not-used marker */\n        Widget          dialog;\t\t\t/* could cache&carry, but ...*/\n        Arg             args[3];\n        int             n = 0;\n        XtAppContext    context;\n\n        n=0;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,\n                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;\n        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;\n        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);\n        XtManageChild(dialog);\n\n        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);\n        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {\n                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);\n        }\n        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */\n        return answer;\n  }\n\n\tThe dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same \nfunction when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user \nfinally selects one of those choices:\n\n  void response(w, client, call)\n        Widget          w;\n        XtPointer client;\n        XtPointer call;\n  {\n  int *answer = (int *) client;\n  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;\n        switch (reason->reason) {\n        case XmCR_OK:\n                *answer = RET_YES;\t/* some #define value */\n                break;\n        case XmCR_CANCEL:\n                *answer = RET_NO; \n\t\tbreak;\n        case XmCR_HELP:\n                *answer = RET_HELP;\n                break;\n        default:\n                return;\n        }\n}\n\nand the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and\ncontinues from there.\n\n[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan\'s R3/contrib\nWidgetWrap library. 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?\nI have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.\n\n\tUsers of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which \nwill work on both widgets and non-widget objects.\n\n\tIf you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do \nwhat you want. Note that it depends on the widget\'s internal data structures \nand is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.\n\n\t#include <X11/CoreP.h>\n\t#include <X11/Xresource.h>\n\tString XtName (widget)\n\tWidget widget;\t/* WILL work with non-widget objects */\n\t{\n\treturn XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);\n\t}\n\n[7/90; modified with suggestion by Larry Rogers (larry@boris.webo.dg.com) 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?\nI\'m doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics\nwithin my Xt-based program:\n\n> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */\n> ...\n> window = XtWindow(canvas);\t/* get the window associated with the widget */\n> ...\n> XDrawLine (...,window,...);\t/* produces error */\n\n\tThe window associated with the widget is created as a part of the \nrealization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL ("no window") could \ncreate the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() \nbefore attempting to use the window associated with a widget. \n\tNote that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, \nbut that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also \nwait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?\n\nThe BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of \nthe screen. If you don\'t want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take\nthe following steps to avoid the error:\n\n1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.\n2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.\n3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.\n4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the\nimage from the pixmap.\n5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn\'t clean, and \nthe x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you \nthe parts of the pixmap which aren\'t good.\n6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.\n\n[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?\n\n\tA number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight\ncharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is\nrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:\n\t\n\tdisplay = XOpenDisplay(display_name);\n\tif (display)\n\t\t{ do X stuff }\n\telse\n\t\t{ do curses or something else }\nwhere display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following\n-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case \nXOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].\n\nThis is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line \nargument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is \nadequate. [5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 128)  How do I make a "busy cursor" while my application is computing?\nIs it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?\n\n\tThe easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is \nas large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel \nwindow and it will be clipped to that window, so it won\'t affect any other \napplication. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \ndesktop.) Substitute "toplevel" with your top-most widget here (similar code \nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\n\n     unsigned long valuemask;\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\n\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\n\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\n\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\n32767.\n\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\n\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\n\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\n\n\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \nconnection to the display. \n\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \n\t\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your \nexec. You will then be able to exit the parent.\n\tAlternatively, before exec\'ing make this call, which causes the file \ndescriptor to be closed on exec.\n\t\t(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);\n\n[Thanks to Janet Anstett (anstettj@tramp.Colorado.EDU), Gordon Freedman \n(gjf00@duts.ccc.amdahl.com); 2/91. Greg Holmberg (holmberg@frame.com), 3/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?\n\n\tNo. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical \nsections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \nXlib or Xt functions.\n\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\nhas previously been added.\n\n\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\'Reilly \nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 131)  What are these "Xlib sequence lost" errors?\n\n\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn\'t be doing in any case. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\n\n\tIt\'s very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \nthe other file descriptor.\n\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \nprogram\'s attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\n\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\n\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn\'t input pending.\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\nnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always \nready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning\nand read data you\'ve read before.  The result is that your function will almost\nalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the \ntype of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your \nfunction to test whether there is new data:\n\t     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;\nBut, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a \nbusy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting \na timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.\n\n[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;\nOllie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?\n\n\tYou can do this using XSendEvent(); it\'s likely that you\'re not setting\nthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget\nwhich should receive the event.\n\t If you\'re sending events to your own application, then you can use \nXtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you\navoid a round-trip to the server.\n\tDepending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call\nits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.\n\n[courtesy Mark A.

However, the \nwindow is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --\nuntil your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will \ngenerally not appear. You\'ll see code like this in many programs; this code \nwould appear after window was created and mapped:\n  while (!done)\n    {\n      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);\n      switch (the_event.type) {\n\tcase Expose:\t /* On expose events, redraw */\n\t\tXDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);\n\t\tbreak;\n\t...\n\t}\n    }\n\n\tNote that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don\'t \nset up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background \ncolors, so this program could previously include this code:\n  ...\n  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);\t/* e.g. */\n  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,\n                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);\n  ...\n \nNote: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is \nblack and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 \nand the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be \nreversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.\n\nAlso note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong \nthing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user\'s preference for \nforeground and background.\n\nAnd also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program\nif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may\nnot yet have appeared.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?\n\n\tThe \'Screen\' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about\none of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A \nserver can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,\nunix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the \'screen\' or \'screen_number\' is the second digit --\nthe 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available \nScreens on this particular Display connection.\n\tThe macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular\nScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one\nwhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.\n\tIn Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine \nthe Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.\n\t(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros\nwhich return characteristics of the Screen have "Display" in the names -- \nXDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)\n\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you\'re \nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \nback that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and \nit suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD \nand Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n\tNote that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a \n(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the\npixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the \noriginal pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved. \n[courtesy Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?\n\t\n\tA completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly\nwindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have\nseveral choices:\n\t- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to\nmake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the\nareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers \nsupport the extension.\n\t- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for\nparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note \nthat there is no X notion of a "transparent color index".\n\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\n\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\nthat will appear properly.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\nlast option]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn\'t GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\n\n\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\ncoincidence will break.]\n\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\npre-computed values.\n\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \nblue.\n\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\n\n\tMake sure you\'re using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue \nfields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is \nfull-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) \nthe XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is \nusually black. \n\n[Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 142)  Why can\'t my program get a standard colormap?\nI have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the \nstandard colormap, but it doesn\'t work. \n\n\tXGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does \nnot create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.\nUse xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.\n\n[1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? \n\n\tThe initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most\nservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there \n-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using\nXFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever \ncolor you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a \nmask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?\nMy program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether\nthe window exists before doing anything with it.\n\n\tBecause X is asynchronous, there isn\'t a guarantee that the window \nwould still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an\nevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the\nevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow \nerrors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will\nwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed \nand its ID reallocated to another window.\n\n[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?\n\n\tYes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\n\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\napplications\' running on different machines) is in the first application to \ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\n\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\n\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \ncooperation among your applications. \n\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \nuse the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it \nshould close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.\n\n[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 146)  Why can\'t my program work with tvtwm or swm?\n\n\tA number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not\nhandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return \nthe wrong child of root.

You can try setting \nthe minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. \n[1/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?\n\n\tIt\'s rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself\n[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn\'t overlapped -- \nimagine the conflict between two such programs running.  \n\tThe only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack\nis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily\nassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do \nthis infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup \nmenus or other short parameter-setting windows).\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?\n\n\tThere is no easy way.  Unless you\'re willing to depend on some sort of\nextension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,\neither by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games\nwith the colormap and changing the color of the contents.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?\n\n\tUsers of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help \nget notification of double-clicking.\n\tThere is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the \nprotocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do \nclient-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer\nactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you \nhave to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish \nimplementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of \nthe X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.\n\tNote that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click\nbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case\nin your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise\ncheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should\nbe the single-click action or the double-click action.\n\n[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?\n\t\n\tXlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics \ncapabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics\nlibraries.\n\tYour only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to\nrender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it "by \nhand" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via \nXPutImage(); more specifically:\n\t1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.\n\t2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).\n\t3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.\n\t4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where \n\t\ta = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)\n\t\tb = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n\t5) render I2\n\tNote that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose\nbits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.\n\tThe high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X \nalso permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,\nalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the\nsame fonts that would be found on a printer.\n\tIn addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font\non it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some\npredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each\nglyph.\n\n[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor \n(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;\nLiam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]\n\n\tInterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for\nrendering rotated fonts in X.

(I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions\nin IBM PC magazines)\n\nWell, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,\nbut then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,\n*max*.\n\nHow can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it\nhad to have a DTR of 10megs a second?\n\n(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.\nI admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data\nat 5megs a second!)\n\nThank you.\n\n'

First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,\n  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man\n  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment\n  only dies after all attachments are gone.\n  Now, if the client dies, that\'s one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)\n  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it\'s resources,\n  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more\n  shared memory segment.\n  Terrible, but it works.\n\n\t\t\t\tRegards,\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRichard Gooch....\n'

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\n\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\n\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\na group.\n\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\n\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\nsoftware, I\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\n\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\n\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\n\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\nmessage to the address:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn\'t be too much of a\ndelay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\n\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\n\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\nfollowing address:\n\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\ndoesn\'t mean it hasn\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\ncouldn\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\naddress.\n\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\n\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\n\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\nyou used to sign up:\n\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nIn the body of the message enter:\n\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\n\nI will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join\nthe list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be\nable to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the\nlist!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\nforwarding of the articles to you.\n\n\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\n\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\noriginating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due\nto lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a\ncompendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store\nthem in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an\nindex of the contents of the compendium and any other information that\nrelates.\n\nIf there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI\nhard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>\n\nI have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the\nlist can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past\narticles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to\nthe LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please\nsend a mail message to:\n\n        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nThe first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".\n\nUse HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.\nUse USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.\nUse ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.\n\n\n\n-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --\n\nWell, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have\nsomething to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to\nthe list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes\nsome of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>\n\nIf you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact\nme at the address:\n\n        lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com\n\nCheers,\n\n\nBob Lindabury\n'

Closest to\n   "conventional" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching\n   by comets, it\'s got too many holes in it to count, but at\n   least it was a good try...\n\nSo you have a plausible model for GRB\'s at astronomical distances?\nRecent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star\nhypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for\nimplausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of\nmodels.\n\nA paper on the possibility of GRB\'s in the Oort cloud just came\nthrough the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this\npaper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject\nline \n  get 9304001\n\n\nHere is the abstract of that paper.\n\n   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \\GRBs puts them\n   at cosmological distances;\n   but as long as there is no distance\n   indicator to these events all possible sources which are\n   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is\n   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,\n   although there is no known mechanism for generating \\GRBs\n   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \\GRBs\n   originate in the solar cometary cloud\n   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.\n\n   We use the available data on the distribution of \\GRBs (the BATSE\n   catalogue up to March, 1992), and\n   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to\n   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations\n   between the angular distributions of \\GRBs and comets\' aphelia,\n   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,\n   at least to some extent, true variations\n   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\\vov$\n   test to both distributions.\n\n   We have  performed a variety of statistical tests (a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n   test for the distributions in galactic latitude, a\n   $\\chi^2$ test for the spherical multiple moments, and a 2-D\n   cross-correlation analysis), including testing sub-samples for\n   isolating the effect of possible observational biases.\n   These tests imply that it is unlikely that the two distributions agree, but\n   the statistical significance  is not sufficient for ruling out any\n   connection with complete confidence. We performed Monte-Carlo simulations\n   which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $\\sim 800$\n   it is possible to rule out a correlation between the angular distributions.\n   Currently,\n    it is only the combination of these tests  with the large disagreement\n   found for the $\\vov$ parameter which makes the Oort\n   cloud of comets unlikely to be related to \\GRBs.\n'

Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn\'t be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon\'t have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I\'ll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it\'s all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn\'t find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I\'d bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat\'s a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I\'m not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let\'s round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year\'s supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren\'t they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI\'ve forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I\'m not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn\'t give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I\'d\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.

When using the GetProfileString function in WordBasic, is there a way\nto specify/change the default .INI file (which is win.ini) to MyOwn.INI file?\n\n2. When using the file Input$ function in WordBasic - is there a way to\nread more than the 32k at one time?\n\n---\nAny help will be appreciated.\n\npgupta@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu\n\n'

Try \nreplacing the battery.\n\nIf, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power\nthe CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a \nmore normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave\nyour PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor \ncharged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.\n\nIt's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is \ncorrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and\ncheck out your system.\n"

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\n   (for better or for worse).\n\n   I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\'s a sequence where\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\n\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\n   "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\n   frames.\n\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used\n   for the results I\'d been reporting earlier.\n\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\n\n   That\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\n\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\n   action, not 1.5. I\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\'t think it\'s\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\n\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\n\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\n   "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\'s normal synchronized playback).\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\'t work too well: the playback was\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\n   ease. I can\'t believe that QuickTime\'s synchronization code would add this\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\'s task\n   switching.\n\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\'t see\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\n\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\n   even more...\n\n   Lawrence D\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\' 26" S, 175^ 19\' 7" E, GMT+12:00\n\n\nI\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\'s playback speed that you may want to take\ninto account:\n\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\n\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\n\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\'m not sure about Premiere).\n\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size\nis, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also\nmake a real difference.\n\nForgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...\n\n-Peter Lee\n\n \n--\n/-------------------- Peter E.

Used printers are fine, non-apple\nprinters are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:\n\nRequired features:\n\n- PostScript\n\n- 300 dpi\n\n- emough memory to download fonts\n\n- The cheaper, the better.  I\'d prefer under $1000.\n\n\nNice things:\n\n- anything over 4 pages per minute\n\n- scsi output for a font disk\n\n- smallish footprint\n\n\n\nDon\'t Care About:\n\n- PostScript Level II\n\n- networking (its just for me, and always will be)\n\n- color\n\n\nI know about Freedom of Press, but I\'ve also heard that its painfully slow.\nI can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I\'m not going\nto consider the price savings worth it.  I\'d be curious to hear people\'s\nexperience with it, tho. \n\nI also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in\nmy last job and wasn\'t impressed with the quality.  I\'m a laser bigot\nand the first to admit it. :)\n\n\nI\'ll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I\'m writing.  The\npage will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and\nmaybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn\'t need to\nbe spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.\n\n\nPrinters I\'ve been looking at:\n\n\n- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that\n  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?\n\n- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee\n  discount (I work for one of Apple\'s spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably\n  cheaply.  I\'ve heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I\'m leaning\n  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.\n\n- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn\'t have PostScript, but I haven\'t\n  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a "postscript upgrade."\n  ??\n\n- Used HP LaserJets.  I\'ve worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and\n  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?\n\n- I\'ve seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.\n  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),\n  but if its a decent printer I\'ll consider it.\n\n\nThanks for any comments...\n\n\n\n-- \n*********************************************************\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\n*********************************************************\n\n'

aS"From: games@max.u.washington.edu\nSubject: Words from the Chairman of Boeing on SSTO type stuff\n\n\n  Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\nbare-bones.\n\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\nin.\n\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\n\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\nthe difference.\n\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \n\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\n\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\npart first.\n\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\n\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\nthis point.\n\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\nto persue work on their own.\n\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\ntrying to do something with it.  \n\nAnybody know anything further?\nIs this really news?\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\n\n                    John.\n"

The\nchassis simply couldn\'t be pushed any further.  I\'d say 4 years was\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.

There should be no reason for sales folks\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\nbut that shouldn\'t last too long, and doesn\'t seem to be what you\nare referring to).\n\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus\'s at the end of some (all?) quarters,\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\nsystems that aren\'t what they need, I\'m sure, but nobody is *forcing*\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\n\n| Maybe it\'s because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we\n| aren\'t entitled to a "peek under the covers" as the Big Kids (NASA,\n| for instance) are.

aS'From: jgealow@mtl.mit.edu (Jeffrey C. Gealow)\nSubject: Standard Colormaps\n\nI\'m working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding \nstandard colormaps.\n\nThe X11R5 documentation says: "Usually, a window manager creates \nthese colormaps."  I wonder what window manager the writer had \nin mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.\n\nOf course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  \nHowever, xstdcmap doesn\'t seem to try very hard to avoid \nconflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard \ncolormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  \nSo it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very \nproblem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps \nif every application used standard colormaps, things would \nbe wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use \nstandard colormaps.\n\nFinally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, \nXmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent \nwith the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.\n\n    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):\n\n    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and \n    base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  \n    To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:\n\n            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF\n\n    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is \n    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c\n    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the \n    call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is \n    specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the \n    total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% \n    of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.\n    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation \n    to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.\n\n    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, \n    defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, \n    and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3, \n    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.\n\n    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, \n    XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs \n    a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives \n    the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would \n    expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.\n'

aS"From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle)\nSubject: Replacing internal FDHD w/ floptical?\n\nHi all,  \n\nI have a IIsi with a floppy drive that might be bad (and might just be out\nof alignment, I haven't checked yet. :-))  If the drive is not easily\nreparable, I'd like to replace it with an _internal_ floptical.  Can this\nbe easily done?  Can it be done at all?  \n\nI'm assuming that floptical drives can read and write both 800k and 1.4k\nfloppies.  If this is not in fact true, please tell me.\n\nThanks in advance,\n        ~ Kiran\n\n"

aS'From: nicholas@ibmpcug.co.uk (Nicholas Young)\nSubject: Graphics editor required\n\nSee subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).\n\nI am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited\nabilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must\nrun on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The\nsort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects\nsuch as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are\nsufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the\ncreation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.\ntext entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.\n\nDoes anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details\nincluding price (especially run-time licensing since it must be\nincluded in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica,\n68 Newman Street, London W1, including technical info please.

Windows will use a swap file\nlarger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft\nWindows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information\nthat the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book\nthey handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended\nswapfile".  I\'ll quote the information\n\n  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you\n  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything\n  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we\n  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount\n  of RAM on your machine.\n\nSo as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You\nprobably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only\ntelling you what little he knew.\n\nBe that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the\nopportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren\'t actually\nincredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and\noptimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer\nyou HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick\nup Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.\nThat is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You\ncould also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself\nI sprang for Word.\n\nWell, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone\nwill go to a workshop and save a little money.\n\nAnd if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.\nI need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)\n\nThanks,\nBrent Casavant\nbcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu\n\n'

Most of the C preprocessors that\n        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the\n        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the\n        start of a directive. \n\n        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol\n        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines\n        that "This" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my\n        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better\n        fix.\n\n(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular\n        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp\n        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.\n\nIf you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate\ninformation about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later\nversion of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp\'s\nthat behave similarly?\n\nSince I do not have easy access to News, a response to\n\'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com\' would be appreciated.\n'

I just ordered it.  I currently have\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\n\nHere is my suggestion...\n\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\n\tDOS 6.0\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\n\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\n\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \n\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\n\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\n\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\n\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\n\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\n\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\n\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B" \n\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\n\tI am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That\n\thas been an annoyance.\n\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\n\teffort to upgrade.\n\nJust my $.02 ...\n\nRegards,\nMark Bagdy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nBuddy,\n\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\n\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\nsuch).\n\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\nhappy camper.\n\n-Bruce\n-- \n  Bruce F.
